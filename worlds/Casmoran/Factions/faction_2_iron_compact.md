# **2. The Iron Compact**

### **Type:** Technocratic reconstruction and stabilization order

### **Domains:** Infrastructure, logistics, safety protocol, continuity of civilization

### **Pantheon Resonance:** Arturion (craft), Lorynthos (law), Basturion (steadfast protection)

### **Regions:** Inner Sea rim, Selrya, Lakelands academies, Redspine passes, Dawnwall trade routes

### **Summary**

Where the Verdant Loom tends the land, the Iron Compact tends civilization. This faction views the continent as an interconnected system of roads, bridges, ley-relays, and civic frameworks that must never collapse again. Their central thesis: **civilization is stable only when its infrastructure is stable.** Every failed road is a famine. Every unstable ley conduit is a disaster. Every unregulated magical experiment risks a repeat of the Shattering.

### **Origins & Shattering Legacy**

- **Late-OCE Guild Roots:** The Compact formed from late-imperial engineering guilds, arcano-legal councils, and civic magistrates who recognized empire-scale decay.
- **During the Shattering:** They attempted (and failed) to seal collapsing ley conduits and waygates, but their records of these failures remain invaluable.
- **During the Silence:** Compact enclaves preserved foundational knowledge—blueprints, measurements, arcane safety protocols—and taught communities how to maintain critical structures without magic.

### **Structure**

- **Chain of Nine:** Senior architects and logisticians who define continent-wide standards.
- **Regional Prefects:** Administrators charged with overseeing reconstruction and mediation.
- **Circuitwardens:** Inspectors traveling between regions enforcing safety standards.
- **Reliquarists:** Scholars responsible for cataloging and securing dangerous pre-OCE artifacts.

### **Methods**

- **Standardization:** Unifying measurements, road widths, weights, tariffs, and civic laws.
- **Reconstruction:** Deploying teams to repair major roads and ley-relay towers.
- **Hazard Mitigation:** Identifying unstable relics or magic-nodes and instituting safety perimeters.
- **Legal Mediation:** Intervening in disputes threatening trade networks or public safety.

### **Goals**

- **Short-Term:** Reinforce ley grid stability around the Inner Sea, curb technomantic excess in Selrya, and stabilize failing Redspine passes.
- **Long-Term:** Restore a continent-wide non-imperial network of transit and communication; secure or neutralize all catastrophic OCE relics.

### **Relationships**

- **Allies:** Tide-Sunder Covenant (shared threat modeling), Veilbound Choir (shared focus on continuity).
- **Tense:** Verdant Loom (clashes over ecological costs), Crownless Assembly (politics of authority).
- **Rivals:** Emberlight Pact (destruction of stability), dynastic remnants.

### **Adventure Hooks**

- A ley tower begins emitting harmonic vibrations—an imminent collapse.
- A Circuitwarden uncovers corruption involving sabotage of public works.
- A buried OCE transport node reactivates beneath a trade route.
