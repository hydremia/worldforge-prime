# Casmoran Faction Compendium v1 — Expanded Edition

## **Introduction**

Casmoran is a continent shaped by fracture—physical, magical, cultural, and ideological. When the Shattering obliterated the Old Casmoran Empire and the Silence severed divine magic, mortals survived through improvisation, instinct, and the stubborn endurance of ideas more than institutions. Centuries later, nations have re‑emerged, borders redrawn, and trade rekindled, but the deepest forces guiding the continent are not crowns or armies. They are **ideological factions**—continent-spanning movements whose beliefs and practices influence every macro-region and every major power.

These factions are not unified religions, not political parties, not secret cults, and not mere guilds. They are **philosophical power blocs**, each representing a worldview shaped by the scars of the Shattering and the lessons learned during the Silence. Their adherents come from every species, culture, and social stratum. Some factions operate openly, their symbols proudly worn. Others whisper through dreams or walk unnoticed across the boundaries of reality.

This document expands each faction into a full, detailed reference: their histories, internal disputes, operational methods, political entanglements, pantheon resonance, and GM-ready adventure hooks. This edition includes expanded prose, descriptive detail, and contextual explanations for each bullet point.
