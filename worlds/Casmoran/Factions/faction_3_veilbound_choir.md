### **Summary**

The Veilbound Choir safeguards Casmoran’s collective memory and psychic health. They walk the threshold between dreams and waking, preserving ancestral knowledge, decoding prophetic nightmares, and healing communities traumatized by centuries of upheaval. To them, forgetting the past is the most dangerous act imaginable.

### **Origins & Shattering Legacy**

- **Pre-OCE Roots:** Dreamkeepers tended ancestral memory long before recorded history.
- **During the Shattering:** Nightmares became prophetic horrors; Choir cells preserved visions that warned survivors where to flee.
- **During the Silence:** They collected testimonies and genealogies, storing them in memory-crypts and echo-shrines.

### **Structure**

- **Lantern-Cantors:** Elders who maintain memory-galleries.
- **Dreamweavers:** Practitioners who guide communal dreams.
- **Remembrancers:** Historians of lived experience.
- **Horizon-Walkers:** Vision-seekers who interpret omens.
- **Moonbinders:** Specialists in ancestral communion.

### **Methods**

- Conducting dream-circles to heal communal trauma.
- Intervening in regions afflicted by nightmare storms.
- Preserving ancestral memory in crypts and dream-groves.
- Extracting truths hidden within multi-generational dream-echoes.

### **Goals**

- **Short-Term:** Investigate rising nightmare patterns emerging across the Inner Sea.
- **Long-Term:** Establish a continent-wide dream-path network anchoring psychic stability.

### **Relationships**

- **Allies:** Verdant Loom, Iron Compact
- **Tense:** Crownless Assembly (danger of weaponized truth), Tide-Sunder Covenant
- **Rivals:** Emberlight radicals, dynastic states hiding uncomfortable history

### **Adventure Hooks**

- A town is trapped in a cyclical dream that repeats a forgotten atrocity.
- An inherited memory contradicts recorded history.
- A dream-rift spills ancestral echoes into a physical space.
