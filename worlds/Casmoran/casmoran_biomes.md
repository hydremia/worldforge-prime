# **Casmoran Biomes — Environmental Macro-Zones (v1.0)**

This document defines the six primary **biomes** of Casmoran. Biomes are **environmental macro-zones** that transcend political borders and shape culture, ancestry, lineage variants, and regional identity. They are *not* macro-regions or nations — they are landscape archetypes that impact every species and faction.

## **1. Greenwood**
**Temperate ancient forests • High humidity • Dense canopy • Wild-magic saturation**

The Greenwood biome includes the continent's vast forest arcs, old-growth woods, bloom-prone wildlands, and druidic heartlands. These areas often host Verdant Loom enclaves, fae-touched groves, and dream-thick ecosystems. Life here is layered, cyclical, and resilient.

### Biome Mechanics

- **Travel Difficulty:** **Standard** on established paths; rises to **High** when venturing off‑trail due to dense canopy and uneven ground.
- **Hazard Categories:** Environmental (dense canopy, quicksand, disease), Magical (wild‑magic blooms, awakening flora), Social/Urban (territorial communities), Travel (muddy trails and overgrowth).
- **Encounter Density:** **High** — rich ecosystems and hidden enclaves mean frequent interactions with creatures and inhabitants.
- **Resources:** **Abundant** forage, water, and natural shelter; however, misidentifying plants can lead to poison or disease.
- **Weather Patterns:** **Frequent rainfall and mist** create disadvantage on Perception checks; storms may require **Endurance (Constitution)** checks.
- **Magic & Planar Modifiers:** Magic stability is **flickering** with wild‑magic saturation; planar influence is **mild** under Aerathwyn’s touch.
- **Integration Note:** For per‑region modifications, see Casmoran Macro Regions.

## **2. Basin**
**Fertile lowlands • River networks • Reclaimed farmland • Transitional frontier**

The Basin biome covers wide floodplains, agricultural lowlands, river deltas, and trade-corridor settlements. Historically shaped by OCE agriculture and post-Shattering reclamation, Basin lands blend civilization with frontier risk. Choir, Compact, and Assembly influences often intersect here.

---
### Biome Mechanics

- **Travel Difficulty:** **Standard**; increases to **High** during flood season or in unmaintained marshes.
- **Hazard Categories:** Environmental (flooding, marsh diseases), Magical (ley surges), Social/Urban (banditry and political turmoil), Travel (boggy terrain, river crossings).
- **Encounter Density:** **Medium** — farmland and trade roads produce occasional hazards and meetings with travelers or raiders.
- **Resources:** **Abundant** farmland and water; foraging and hunting are easy.
- **Weather Patterns:** **Humid** climate and seasonal storms may impose penalties on ranged attacks or require **Constitution** checks to avoid exhaustion.
- **Magic & Planar Modifiers:** Magic stability is **stable** but may become **flickering** near leyline junctions or fractured canals.
- **Integration Note:** See Casmoran Macro Regions for regional overlays.

## **3. Coast**
**Maritime climate • Saltwinds • Tidal cultures • Storm exposure**

Coast biomes represent shorelines, peninsulas, littoral trade cities, fishing clans, and island chains. Seas, storms, and tides define life here. Mirethiel, Thalvyr, and Tessimir influence local traditions. Coastal societies tend toward adaptability and negotiation with the sea.

---
### Biome Mechanics

- **Travel Difficulty:** **Standard** along coastlines and calm seas; increases to **High** during storm seasons or open‑ocean voyages.
- **Hazard Categories:** Environmental (sea storms, salt winds, erosion), Magical (planar anomalies in reefs and sea trenches), Social/Urban (piracy, merchant conflicts), Travel (navigation errors, shipwrecks, rogue waves).
- **Encounter Density:** **Medium** — storms and sea creatures present intermittent hazards; harbors are relatively safe.
- **Resources:** **Plentiful** fish and trade goods; fresh water may be scarce on islands.
- **Weather Patterns:** **Storm exposure** leads to disadvantage on ranged attacks and navigation checks; high winds can delay travel.
- **Magic & Planar Modifiers:** Magic stability is **stable** near shore but becomes **volatile** near planar anomalies or in deeper waters.
- **Integration Note:** See Casmoran Macro Regions for region‑specific maritime hazards.

## **4. Highlands**
**Plateaus • Mesas • High plains • Storm-swept elevations**

The Highlands biome includes plateau cultures, steppe nomads, mesa settlements, and exposed highlands shaped by elemental winds. Emberlight philosophies, nomadic trials, and storm-forged traditions define these regions. Sparse vegetation but rich cultural diversity.

---
### Biome Mechanics

- **Travel Difficulty:** **High** due to elevation gains, exposed mesas, and frequent storms.
- **Hazard Categories:** Environmental (high winds, lightning, thin air), Structural (rockfalls and landslides), Magical (skyfire storms and elemental anomalies), Travel (steep ascents, mesas, canyon crossings).
- **Encounter Density:** **Medium** — hazards are more environmental than creature‑driven, though nomad skirmishes occur.
- **Resources:** **Limited**; water and forage are scarce; travellers rely on caches, wells, or trade with nomads.
- **Weather Patterns:** **Storm‑swept**; high winds can impose disadvantage on movement and may trigger Exhaustion checks.
- **Magic & Planar Modifiers:** Magic stability is **flickering**, with storm‑triggered anomalies and planar thin spots.
- **Integration Note:** See Casmoran Macro Regions for Dawnwall and other highland overlays.

## **5. Mountains**
**Ridges • Forges • Caverns • Glacial heights**

Mountain biomes encompass Dawnwall, Redspine, and Highmark Hold regions — mineral-rich ridgelines, deep caverns, volcanic seams, and massive tectonic formations. Dwarven, giant-kin, and forge cultures dominate here. Vharûn's influence is strong in myth and craft.

---
### Biome Mechanics

- **Travel Difficulty:** **High to Extreme**; hazards are constant and terrain is treacherous.
- **Hazard Categories:** Environmental (avalanches, cold, sulfur vents), Structural (collapses and cave‑ins), Magical (reactive ore seams, planar rifts), Travel (treacherous passes, altitude sickness).
- **Encounter Density:** **Medium to High** — monsters, bandits, and elemental creatures are common in passes and caves.
- **Resources:** **Scarce**; forage is limited; travellers risk altitude sickness and require specialized gear.
- **Weather Patterns:** **Blizzards and extreme cold** can impose multiple Exhaustion checks and may block routes entirely.
- **Magic & Planar Modifiers:** Magic stability is **volatile** due to reactive ore; planar influence is **active** in rifts and deep caverns.
- **Integration Note:** See Casmoran Macro Regions for Redspine, Dawnwall, and Highmark overlays.

## **6. Inner Sea**
**Cultural crossroads • Arcane residues • Mixed terrain • Historical epicenters**

The Inner Sea biome surrounds the Shattering cradle — a mixture of reclaimed ruins, diverse city-states, fertile valleys, arcane anomalies, and major trade arteries. Almost every faction is present here. This biome functions as Casmoran’s cosmopolitan anchor.

---
### Biome Mechanics

- **Travel Difficulty:** **High**; hazards are abundant both on land and at sea.
- **Hazard Categories:** Environmental (whirlpools, currents, underwater terrain), Magical (planar scars, wild magic surges, anti‑magic zones), Structural (sunken ruins and shifting debris), Social/Urban (conflicts among factions), Travel (shipwrecks, treacherous currents).
- **Encounter Density:** **High** — ruins are dangerous and contested by many groups; arcane anomalies attract opportunists.
- **Resources:** **Moderate**; fish and salvage are plentiful, but safe ports and fresh water are precious.
- **Weather Patterns:** **Unpredictable storms**; currents and tides can carry ships off course; navigation checks are essential.
- **Magic & Planar Modifiers:** Magic stability is **volatile**; planar influence is **severe** with overlapping effects from Zephrix, Yhesseth, and Omyr.
- **Integration Note:** See Casmoran Macro Regions for detailed Inner Sea overlays.
