## **4.1 Mountain Gnomes**
**Summary:** Mountain Gnomes are ingenious, frost-tested engineers who build cliffside workshops, cold-resistant tools, and seismic devices. Their settlements cling to rock faces, supported by reinforced lattice-tunnels and echo chambers designed to detect shifts deep within the stone.

**Physical Traits:** Compact and sturdy; soot-dusted faces; bright eyes; frost-nipped cheeks; heavy gloves and tool-belts loaded with implements.

**Culture:** Cavern laboratories, ore-mapping guildlets, avalanche-warning drums, experimental forges. Craft competitions are common, with emphasis on practical innovations.

**History:** Known for preserving Silence-era geological instruments and fault sensors — some of which still function thanks to collective tinkering lore.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Iron Compact:** Trusted for engineering precision.
- **Tide-Sunder:** Consulted for fault prediction and detection of rift strain.

**Perceptions:** Brilliant, eccentric, typically fearless around unstable stone.

## **4.2 Basin Gnomes**
**Summary:** Basin Gnomes are millwrights, canal-mappers, and mechanical problem-solvers who thrive in bustling mixed settlements. Their focus is practical innovation rather than theory.

**Physical Traits:** Ink- or oil-stained hands; expressive features; practical clothing reinforced at the elbows and knees.

**Culture:** Mixed-town integration; tinkering clubs; communal workshops; lively debates on machinery efficiency.

**History:** Many inherited or reverse-engineered leftover OCE devices, maintaining a tradition of "repair first, question later."

**Faction Influence:**
- **Iron Compact:** Infrastructure work and device maintenance.
- **Crownless Assembly:** Some align with reformist guild movements.

**Perceptions:** Meddlesome but invaluable; no problem too small to take apart.

## **4.3 Coast Gnomes**
**Summary:** Coast Gnomes combine maritime adaptability with inventive chaos. Their creations often merge buoyancy tricks, pressure gauges, and wind funnels — brilliant until they catastrophically aren’t.

**Physical Traits:** Windswept hair; sun freckles; vests covered in pockets; goggles for surf spray or debris.

**Culture:** Floating workshops, pier communes, tideswept laboratories. They cultivate a tradition of "test it on the water, fix it on the shore."

**History:** Innovators of Silence-era drift-harvest devices, tide turbines, and improvised salvage rigs.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Iron Compact:** Practical engineering.
- **Crownless Assembly:** Anti-monopoly agitation in coastal cities.

**Perceptions:** Clever, fearless, occasionally unhinged.

---

## **4.4 Inner Sea Gnomes**
**Summary:** Inner Sea Gnomes are urban intellectuals, civic engineers, and logistical masterminds who keep cities running. They thrive in bureaucratic labyrinths and arcane-adjacent workshops.

**Physical Traits:** Ink-stained fingers; eccentric fashion; animated gestures.

**Culture:** Guild scribaries, arcane startups, messenger networks, public works tinker-crews. Organized chaos is the highest art.

**History:** Played a central role in restoring municipal arcane systems during Reconstruction.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Iron Compact:** Innovation and regulation.
- **Crownless Assembly:** Worker representation in guild councils.

**Perceptions:** Verbose, clever, indispensable.

---

## **4.5 Highlands Gnomes**
**Summary:** Highlands Gnomes are kinetic inventors touched by the Plateau’s storms and winds. They excel in devices that harness motion — wind pressure, resonance, lightning, and vibration.

**Physical Traits:** Featherlight step; sunfreckles; hair that won’t behave in the wind.

**Culture:** Caravan tinkers, cliffside labs, open-air demonstrations, storm-ballad duels. Creativity is a competitive sport.

**History:** Experimented with pre-Shattering windmills and lightning rods long before their neighbors trusted the technology.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Emberlight Pact:** Trial devices and storm gear.
- **Iron Compact:** Select engineering schools find their innovations useful.

**Perceptions:** Energetic, unreliable, brilliant.

---

## **4.6 Greenwood Gnomes**
**Summary:** Greenwood Gnomes are fungal gardeners, dream-path mediators, and forest-spirit diplomats. They blend whimsy with ancient tradition.

**Physical Traits:** Bright eyes; natural pigments; clothing of leafcloth, barkfiber, or woven moss.

**Culture:** Mycelial garden care, glade custodianship, spirit negotiations, dream-path rituals.

**History:** Preserved grove-path maps and fungal lore through the Shattering.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Veilbound Choir:** Dream-path work.
- **Verdant Loom:** Ecological harmony.

**Perceptions:** Whimsical yet deeply wise.

## **4.7 Planar-Touched Overlays (Sevenfold Canon)**

The following planar-touched overlays can manifest in **Gnomes** (as in any Casmoran lineage). For full mechanical details, use the standard Aasimar / Tiefling / Genasi options reskinned as below, and refer to the dedicated Planar-Touched document.

- **Twilight-Touched (Aasimar analog):** Dreamfold resonance, omen-lit presence, ancestral memory echoes.
- **Riftborne (Tiefling analog):** Shattering-scar instability, uncanny timing, probability slippage rather than fiendish blood.
- **Storm-Touched (Air Genasi analog):** Lightning and wind affinity, storm-charged aura, ease with heights and rapid movement.
- **Tideborn (Water Genasi analog):** Instinctive feel for tides, currents, and floods; sea-and-river attunement.
- **Bloom-Touched (Earth Genasi analog):** Flora-focused wild magic, growth surges, subtle plant resonance instead of bare stone.
- **Frostborne (Fire Genasi analog, cold-refit):** Cold-plane inversion of fire traits—hoarfrost aura, ice-aspected resilience and magic.
- **Leyborne (Unique Casmoran overlay):** Descendants or survivors of the OCE portal lattice collapse, marked by geometric features and spatial/structural intuition; metaphysically displaced into Casmoran rather than native-born planar ties.
