# Casmoran Subspecies Lineages — Beastfolk (Cultural Strains)

Beastfolk are not a single species but a **mythic family** of ancestries shaped by ecosystems, ancient animal patrons, and the geomythic pressures of Casmoran. Variations arise primarily through **biome-shaped cultural strains**, not through genetics alone. A wolfkin born in the Basin is culturally and behaviorally distinct from one raised in the Greenwood or Highlands.

This rebuild provides a clean, unified version of all six biome-linked Beastfolk strains.

Order:
7.1 Basin — River-Clans
7.2 Greenwood — Wildclades
7.3 Coast — Tideclades
7.4 Mountain — Stoneclades
7.5 Highlands — Stormclades
7.6 Inner Sea — Crossroads Clades

All entries include: examples, summary, culture, roles, faction adjacency, and perceptions.

## **7.5 Highlands Beastfolk — Stormclades**
**Example Species:** ramfolk (plateau variant), eaglefolk, antelopekin, coyotefolk, hyenakin.

## **7.6 Inner Sea Beastfolk — Crossroads Clades**
**Example Species:** dogfolk, catfolk, ratfolk, foxfolk, seabirdfolk, hyenakin, mixed-clan hybrids.

**Summary:** Crossroads Clades arise in dense multicultural cities around the Inner Sea where families, guilds, and traditions blend freely.

## **7.7 Planar-Touched Overlays (Applicability to Beastfolk)**

Beastfolk of any strain (River-Clans, Wildclades, Tideclades, Stoneclades, Stormclades, Crossroads Clades) can also manifest **planar-touched overlays**. These do not create new Beastfolk species; they layer the Sevenfold planar signatures onto existing beastfolk cultures.

Common combinations include:
- **Storm-Touched Tideclades** riding hurricane fronts.
- **Bloom-Touched Wildclades** tied to bloomfronts and druidic groves.
- **Riftborne Crossroads Clades** born near Inner Sea scars.
- **Leyborne Beastfolk** whose ancestors were displaced into Casmoran during OCE lattice collapse.

Mechanically, use the same Sevenfold options (Twilight-Touched, Riftborne, Storm-Touched, Tideborn, Bloom-Touched, Frostborne, Leyborne) as with any other species, flavored through the relevant beast-totem and biome.
