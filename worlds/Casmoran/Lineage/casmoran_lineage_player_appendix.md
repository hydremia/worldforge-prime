# **Section C — Player Guide: Choosing Your Lineage in Casmoran**
This section helps players **build a character that feels native** to Casmoran while staying mechanically simple.

---
## **C1. Step 1 — Pick Your Species**
Ask:
- What *role* do you want to play?  
- What *tone* fits that?  
- Do you want to be tied to a specific faction or region?

**General guidance:**
- **Humans** → flexibility and political depth.
- **Elves** → lore, memory, spiritual resonance.
- **Dwarves** → infrastructure, honor, stability.
- **Gnomes** → creativity, chaos, spark.
- **Halflings** → social glue, mobility, cheerful resilience.
- **Orcs/Half-Orcs** → conviction, strength, trials.
- **Beastfolk** → primal identity and biome-shaped culture.

---
## **C2. Step 2 — Choose Your Biome Lineage**
This determines **cultural identity**, not mechanics.

Questions to ask:
- Were you raised in forests? Mountains? Stormlands? Cities?
- What shaped your worldview—community, trials, trade, survival?

Biome = your personal backstory’s backbone.

---
## **C3. Step 3 — Decide if You Are Planar-Touched**
If yes, pick from the **Sevenfold**.  
This adds **flavor**, not major power spikes.

### Best choices by archetype:
- **Visionary / healer / mystic** → Twilight-Touched
- **Troubled prodigy / chaotic magic** → Riftborne
- **Warrior / scout / storm-walker** → Storm-Touched
- **Druid / monk / sailor** → Tideborn
- **Ranger / primal caster** → Bloom-Touched
- **Warden / frost mage / barbarian** → Frostborne
- **Lore-seeker / anomalous arrival** → Leyborne

---
## **C4. Highlight: Leyborne as Story Fuel**
If you choose **Leyborne**, you’re signaling:
- mysterious displacement,
- potential connection to pre-Shattering knowledge,
- inherent ties to the OCE collapse,
- possible factions watching or studying you.

Leyborne = *built-in plot arc*. Use it.

---
## **C5. Step 4 — Choose Your Faction or remain Unaligned**
Your lineage influences—but does not dictate—your faction.

If you want:
- **spiritual or dream focus:** Choir
- **ecology & balance:** Loom
- **infrastructure, order:** Compact
- **storms, trials, conviction:** Emberlight
- **coastal resilience, rifts:** Tide-Sunder
- **people-power & reform:** Assembly

---
## **C6. Step 5 — Finalize Personality & Story Hooks**
Ask:
- What does my biome lineage value?  
- How does my planar-touched status complicate life?  
- Which faction sees potential in me?  
- Which region(s) shaped my beliefs?  

These answers immediately anchor your character to Casmoran’s cultures.
