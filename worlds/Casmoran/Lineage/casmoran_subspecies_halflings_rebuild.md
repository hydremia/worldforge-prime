## **5.1 Mountain Halflings**
**Summary:** Mountain Halflings survive where few others dare—narrow switchbacks, cliffside trails, and icebound passes. They are known for their astonishing surefootedness and readiness to guide others through deadly terrain.

**Physical Traits:** Lean frames, long strides for their height, heavy cloaks, thick-soled footwear. Cheeks redden easily from mountain cold; hair often bound tight against wind.

**Culture:** Cliff burrows carved into sheltered rock; small caravan trails linking scattered holds; winter feasts celebrating survival rather than harvest. Many clans maintain ancient signal-flame systems.

**History:** Vital messengers during the Silence who kept mountain trade lines alive when larger forces failed. Some families still hold hereditary "pass-rights."

**Faction Influence:**
- **Crownless Assembly:** High representation in free caravans.
- **Iron Compact:** Sometimes contracted for high-pass maintenance and guidance.

**Perceptions:** Small but unstoppable—mountainfolk swear by their guidance.

## **5.2 Basin Halflings**
**Summary:** Basin Halflings are the logistical lifeblood of riverlands and farmlands. They excel at travel, supply lines, record keeping, and maintaining social continuity.

**Physical Traits:** Compact builds, strong legs, warm earth-toned clothing. Often carry ledger-charms, knot-records, or small tokens commemorating routes traveled.

**Culture:** Clan networks that tie multiple towns together; caravanner traditions; river-inn families; seasonal gatherings where news is exchanged and marriages arranged.

**History:** Served as oral historians who preserved inter-settlement communication during eras of fractured governance.

**Summary:** Coast Halflings thrive in harbors, barge-clans, and dockside quarters. They are adaptable, cheerful, and capable of astonishing agility on wet decks.

**Physical Traits:** Sun-browned skin; salt-scruffed curls; light-footed movement. Clothing often includes waterproofed capes, belts with many pockets, and sea-charms.

**Culture:** Harbor inns, barge-kinship crews, tide-calendar keeping, fishery management, dockside messenger guilds. Community often revolves around shared meals and storm rituals.

**History:** Long tradition as ship’s quartermasters and shoreline guides; some clans trace roots to early Shattering-era refugee fleets.

**Physical Traits:** Diverse coloration; practical citywear with personal flair; often decorated with ribbons, brooches, or trade symbols.

**Culture:** Neighborhood councils, messenger guilds, festival societies, courier networks. Many Inner Sea halflings maintain communal archives of family stories.

**History:** Maintained communication and logistics during Reconstruction bottlenecks, earning deep trust across species.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Crownless Assembly:** Civic autonomy advocates.
- **Veilbound Choir:** Guardians of oral tradition and dream-memory.

**Perceptions:** Welcoming, adaptable, and with surprising political awareness.

## **5.5 Highlands Halflings**
**Summary:** Highlands Halflings are horizon-walkers and caravan scouts who read weather, terrain, and animal behavior with uncanny precision.

**Physical Traits:** Lean, wiry builds; sun-hardened skin; bright woven sashes; belts equipped for fast travel.

**Culture:** Story-knots exchanged across clans, wind-signal traditions, cliffside homesteads, and open-circle councils that settle disputes by recitation rather than combat.

**History:** Maintained inter-clan communication lines during the Silence, especially across storm-prone mesas.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Emberlight Pact:** Admired for their endurance and trial-taking.
- **Crownless Assembly:** Caravan solidarity.

**Perceptions:** Quick, clever, impossible to corner.

## **5.6 Greenwood Halflings**
**Summary:** Greenwood Halflings are glade wanderers and arboreal foragers who work in harmony with druids, forest spirits, and bloomfront patterns.

**Physical Traits:** Freckled, warm-toned skin; layered patchwork clothing; leaf and vine adornments.

**Culture:** Glade-caravans, seasonal migratory routes, forest trade circles, collaborative decision-making guided by druids and elders.

**History:** Historic ties to root-caravan ancestry and deep forest settlements.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Verdant Loom:** Their practices often align with forest stewardship.
- **Veilbound Choir:** Maintain dream-path lore tied to woodland memory.

**Perceptions:** Beloved wanderers, whimsical but grounded.

## **5.7 Planar-Touched Overlays (Sevenfold Canon)**

The following planar-touched overlays can manifest in **Halflings** (as in any Casmoran lineage). For full mechanical details, use the standard Aasimar / Tiefling / Genasi options reskinned as below, and refer to the dedicated Planar-Touched document.

- **Twilight-Touched (Aasimar analog):** Dreamfold resonance, omen-lit presence, ancestral memory echoes.
- **Riftborne (Tiefling analog):** Shattering-scar instability, uncanny timing, probability slippage rather than fiendish blood.
- **Storm-Touched (Air Genasi analog):** Lightning and wind affinity, storm-charged aura, ease with heights and rapid movement.
- **Tideborn (Water Genasi analog):** Instinctive feel for tides, currents, and floods; sea-and-river attunement.
- **Bloom-Touched (Earth Genasi analog):** Flora-focused wild magic, growth surges, subtle plant resonance instead of bare stone.
- **Frostborne (Fire Genasi analog, cold-refit):** Cold-plane inversion of fire traits—hoarfrost aura, ice-aspected resilience and magic.
- **Leyborne (Unique Casmoran overlay):** Descendants or survivors of the OCE portal lattice collapse, marked by geometric features and spatial/structural intuition; metaphysically displaced into Casmoran rather than native-born planar ties.
