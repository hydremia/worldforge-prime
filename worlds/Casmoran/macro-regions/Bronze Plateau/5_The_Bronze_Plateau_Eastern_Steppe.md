A sweeping semi-arid grassland of golden plains, scattered stone monoliths, and boundless sky. Nomadic societies—centaur clans, orcish steppe-families, beastfolk herds, human riders, and elemental-blooded tribes—move with the seasons. The Steppe retains a strong cultural memory of early human arrival and the mingling of species long before the OCE existed.

The Shattering unleashed immense **arcane windstorms**, twisting weather into hazardous patterns still visible today: mirage-horizons, drifting sky-beasts, and pockets where Thalvyr’s storms merge with Zephrix’s planar instabilities. The Plateau’s spiritual life is dominated by mobile shrines honoring Emberith’s fire of change, Tessimir’s travel-blessings, and ancestral totems echoing pre-OCE deities.

Virtually no single power dominates this region; every clan guards its autonomy fiercely, and attempts at unification tend to end in spectacular failure.
