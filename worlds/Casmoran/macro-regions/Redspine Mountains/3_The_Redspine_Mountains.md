A colossal western mountain chain carved with volcanic peaks, basalt cliffs, sulfur vents, and deep networked caverns. The Redspine was once the beating heart of dwarven civilization and stone-kin culture, but the Shattering’s subterranean shockwaves ruptured entire holds, collapsed arteries of trade, and awakened pockets of unstable magic-reactive ore.

Vharûn’s influence is everywhere—monolithic cairns, forge-temples, and mountain roads built with impossible precision. Arturion’s faithful labor to rebuild broken passes, often clashing with Aerathwyn’s druids where nature tries to reclaim abandoned citadels. Orc clans and dwarfholds coexist uneasily in the foothills, forming unique hybrid cultures shaped by Emberith’s fire of transformation.

Explorers still uncover sealed OCE vaults buried under miles of stone—some containing pre-Shattering machines meant to stabilize regions, others corroded by Yhesseth’s creeping entropy.
