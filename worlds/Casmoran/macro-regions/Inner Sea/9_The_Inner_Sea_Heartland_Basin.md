The drowned cradle of the Old Casmoran Empire, formed when the final catastrophe of the Shattering collapsed entire districts into a massive basin that later filled with water. Its shores contain layers of history: sunken OCE capitals, broken leyline pylons, shattered waygates, and ruin-islands protruding from the water.

Magic is **strongest and most volatile** here. Zephrix’s planar scars, Yhesseth’s anti-magic zones, and lingering Omyr-echoes create an ever-shifting arcane landscape. Emberith’s influence fuels conflict among rising successor powers, while Basturion’s protectors attempt to stabilize fragile alliances. Mirethiel’s waters and Aerathwyn’s overgrowth reclaim ruined districts at unnatural speed.

The Heartland Basin is the political, magical, and historical nexus of Casmoran. Every major power covets it, no one controls it, and every expedition into its depths risks altering the balance of the entire continent.
