A dense crescent of ancient forests, enchanted glades, wetlands, and fertile riverlands. The Greenwood is a living tapestry of civilizations layered over millennia—elven kingdoms, beastfolk courts, halfling river-holds, human frontier towns, and planar-bloodline enclaves shaped by the unique magical history of the region.

Aerathwyn’s presence is palpable; wild-magic blooms, awakenings of flora and fauna, and living-grove sanctuaries dot the land. Umbrayel’s dream-keepers maintain soft boundaries between waking and dreaming. Emberith’s fire fuels artistic enclaves and transformational rituals, while Yhesseth’s entropy creeps in old war-scarred glades where the Shattering burned the land raw.

Territorial but not hostile, Greenwood communities prize harmony, balance, and regional identity. Outsiders rapidly learn that the forest itself has opinions.
