# Zephrix, the Planewrecker (Tier-2 Deity Profile)

## I. Core Identity

**Zephrix, the Planewrecker**, is the Outer Walker of instability, planar pressure, arcane rupture, wild magic storms, dimensional fractures, and the catastrophic beauty that erupts when the multiverse presses too hard against mortal reality. Zephrix is not a god in the traditional sense—he is a *cosmic condition given will*, a conscious faultline, a living stress-fracture in the architecture of planes.

His influence is never calm. He is the tremor before the breach, the static-laced wind over a dormant rift, the flicker of impossible colors at the edge of vision, the spell that twists into something other than what was cast.

Mortals do not worship Zephrix for comfort or guidance. They approach him as one approaches a storm wall—respectfully, fearfully, and with the understanding that survival hinges on acknowledging the danger rather than denying it.

## II. Domains, Aspects, and Divine Nature

**Primary Domains:** Planar Instability, Wild Magic, Rifts, Rupture, Dimensional Storms, Volatility.  
**Secondary Aspects:** Mutation, Arcane Anomalies, Unpredictability, Pressure, Cataclysm.

Zephrix exists wherever boundaries fail. He is attracted to weakened points in reality and amplifies them, either consciously or as a force of nature with awareness. His magic manifests through:
- sudden planar tears,
- spells that detonate in unpredictable forms,
- creatures mutating or shifting types,
- gravity flickering,
- time stuttering,
- arcane residue crystallizing into alien shapes.

Zephrix embodies *potential without structure*, mana without rules.
