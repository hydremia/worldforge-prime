# Mirethiel, the River-Steward (Tier-2 Deity Profile)

## I. Core Identity

**Mirethiel, the River-Steward** is the Elder Power of flowing waters, cycles of renewal, nourishment, migration, tides, and the web of life that connects all beings. She embodies the truth that nothing remains still—every life, every journey, every generation flows forward. Mirethiel is gentle and nurturing, yet capable of overwhelming force when her currents swell; water remembers, restores, and reclaims. Her presence is felt in quiet streams, roaring rivers, misted lakeshores, and the rhythmic tides of the Inner Sea.

Mirethiel is beloved by lakeland peoples, halflings, fisherfolk, farmers, sailors, river-nomads, and scholars of natural cycles. She teaches that life moves in patterns and returns in rhythms, and that the health of water reflects the health of the world.
