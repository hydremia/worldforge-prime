# Yhesseth, the Unraveler (Tier-2 Deity Profile)

## I. Core Identity

**Yhesseth, the Unraveler**, is the Outer Walker of entropy, dissolution, cosmic hunger, inevitable endings, decay without renewal, and the quiet annihilation that underlies all existence. Unlike Umbrayel, who guides souls gently through the cycle, Yhesseth is the *absence* of cycle—the end without continuation, the void after memory fades, the cold that follows heat, the silence after meaning erodes.

She is the tension in aging structures, the rot that spreads through forgotten corners, the gravitational pull toward stillness, the unraveling of spells, the collapse of ruined empires. Yhesseth is not malicious—she is patient inevitability. Her presence is felt in:
- abandoned wastelands,
- long-dead cities swallowed by dust,
- artifacts crumbling into powder,
- magic dissipating into inert nothing,
- starless night skies where the world seems thin.

Those who serve Yhesseth do so out of reverence for truth, nihilistic devotion, or the desire to see false things torn away. She is the final check against excess, growth without balance, and immortality without consequence.

## II. Domains, Aspects, and Divine Nature

**Primary Domains:** Entropy, Decay, Dissolution, Oblivion, Corrosion, Ending.  
**Secondary Aspects:** Hunger, Silence, Collapse, Dust, Anti-Magic.

Yhesseth is the universe's default state: structured things break down. Magic disperses. Life decays. Ideas fade. She is not an active destroyer but the force that ensures nothing resists eternity.

Her divine influence manifests as:
- spells failing or unraveling,
- structures collapsing spontaneously,
- wounds that refuse to heal,
- rust and rot spreading unnaturally fast,
- memories fading or erasing themselves,
- pockets of magic-dead zones.

Yhesseth’s essence is slow, inevitable, and inescapable.
