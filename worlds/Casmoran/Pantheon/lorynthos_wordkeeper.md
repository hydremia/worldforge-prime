# Lorynthos, the Wordkeeper (Tier-2 Deity Profile)

## I. Core Identity

**Lorynthos, the Wordkeeper** is the Concordant God of knowledge, memory, language, chronicles, and the stewardship of truth. He embodies the belief that civilizations rise not from power or wealth, but from understanding—shared records, honest accounts, laws written plainly, stories carried across generations. Where Umbrayel guards the memories of souls, Lorynthos guards the **memory of the world itself**.

His presence is felt in libraries warmed by candlelight, in quiet scriptoria where quills whisper across parchment, in the recitation of ancient treaties, in classrooms beneath shade trees, and in the moment someone learns a truth that reshapes their life.

Lorynthos values clarity, preservation, precision, and the belief that truth—properly kept—prevents the tragedies of forgetting.

## II. Domains, Aspects, and Divine Nature

**Primary Domains:** Knowledge, Memory, Language, History, Truth, Records, Learning.  
**Secondary Aspects:** Runes, Codices, Literacy, Scholarship, Oaths, Lorecraft.

Lorynthos’s divine nature is quiet yet immense. A single revelation can shift the course of history more powerfully than any sword. His magic flows through:
- sudden insights,
- recovered records,
- languages understood in moments of crisis,
- memories preserved despite trauma,
- truths uncovered that heal or illuminate.

The Wordkeeper is patient but relentless—truth *will* surface, and lies inevitably collapse under their own weight.
