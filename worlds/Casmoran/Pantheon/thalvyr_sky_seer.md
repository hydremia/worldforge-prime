# Thalvyr, the Sky-Seer (Tier-2 Deity Profile)

## I. Core Identity

**Thalvyr, the Sky-Seer** is the Elder Power of storms, wind, horizons, freedom, and revelation through change. Thalvyr is never still—an eternal force of motion, transition, and insight that arrives like a sudden gale. The deity’s presence is felt in every shifting sky: a warning in distant thunder, a blessing in guiding winds, a prophecy in a lightning flash. Thalvyr embodies both clarity and chaos, the truth revealed only in motion.

Sailors, travelers, nomads, sky-watchers, storm-callers, and oracles revere Thalvyr. To follow Thalvyr is to walk a path without permanence—to embrace the unknown and trust that the sky will reveal what earth hides.
