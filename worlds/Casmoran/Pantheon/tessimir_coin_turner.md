# Tessimir, the Coin‑Turner (Tier-2 Deity Profile)

## I. Core Identity

**Tessimir, the Coin-Turner**, is the Concordant God of commerce, chance, negotiation, luck, trade winds, opportunity, and the ever-shifting currents that move wealth and possibility across Casmoran. Where Arturion builds the roads and Basturion keeps them safe, Tessimir ensures those roads *matter*—that goods move, deals are struck, fortunes rise and fall, and communities flourish through exchange.

He is the soft clink of coins, the thrill of risk, the hum of a crowded market, the breeze pushing a ship toward profit, the gambler’s heartbeat before the final roll. Tessimir is no deity of greed—he governs *flow*. Wealth that stagnates is cursed; wealth that circulates becomes blessing.

His presence is felt anywhere people trade stories, favors, knowledge, goods, or risks.
