# Casmoran Faction Compendium v1 — Expanded Edition

## **Introduction**

Casmoran is a continent shaped by fracture—physical, magical, cultural, and ideological. When the Shattering obliterated the Old Casmoran Empire and the Silence severed divine magic, mortals survived through improvisation, instinct, and the stubborn endurance of ideas more than institutions. Centuries later, nations have re‑emerged, borders redrawn, and trade rekindled, but the deepest forces guiding the continent are not crowns or armies. They are **ideological factions**—continent-spanning movements whose beliefs and practices influence every macro-region and every major power.

These factions are not unified religions, not political parties, not secret cults, and not mere guilds. They are **philosophical power blocs**, each representing a worldview shaped by the scars of the Shattering and the lessons learned during the Silence. Their adherents come from every species, culture, and social stratum. Some factions operate openly, their symbols proudly worn. Others whisper through dreams or walk unnoticed across the boundaries of reality.

This document expands each faction into a full, detailed reference: their histories, internal disputes, operational methods, political entanglements, pantheon resonance, and GM-ready adventure hooks. This edition includes expanded prose, descriptive detail, and contextual explanations for each bullet point.

# **1. The Concord of the Verdant Loom**

### **Type:** Open ideological order / druidic-civic ecological consortium

### **Domains:** Ecosystems, cycles, renewal, interspecies alliance, wild-magic recovery

### **Pantheon Resonance:** Aerathwyn (wild growth), Mirethiel (rivers), Umbrayel (memory)

### **Regions:** Greenwood Arc, Lakelands basins, Dawnwall mesas, Steppe migration corridors

### **Summary**

The Verdant Loom understands Casmoran as a living organism—one wounded by magical trauma, climate disruption, and the hubris of empire. Their doctrine is simple: if the land dies, civilization soon follows. Members of the Loom include druids, herbalists, river wardens, beastfolk councils, dryad communes, and mortal scholars who recognize the interconnected health of ecosystems and societies. They see themselves not as rulers but as **caretakers**, ensuring mortals never again sever themselves from the natural world.

### **Origins & Shattering Legacy**

The Loom’s identity predates the Old Casmoran Empire. Ancient elf and beastfolk traditions formed proto-circles responsible for balancing early settlements with forest, river, and seasonal cycles.

- **During the Shattering:** Instead of attempting to fight magic with magic, Loom circles redirected wild surges into controlled bloom zones—sacrificing uninhabited stretches of land to shield living communities.
- **During the Silence:** They preserved agriculture when magic failed, using old cyclical rites and knowledge of soil stewardship to keep communities alive. Many villages still repeat rituals whose origins lie in Loom survival doctrine.

### **Structure**

- **Loomroot Council:** An infrequent but powerful gathering of elder druids, beastfolk matriarchs, and river-loremasters. They set broad philosophical direction but rarely intervene directly.
- **Circles:** Regional groups that manage reforestation, river health, soil renewal, and ecological diplomacy. Each Circle reflects its biome.
- **Seed-Cairns:** Living libraries—groves storing plant lore, ancestral seeds, and ecological records protected by caretakers.
- **Wandersibs:** Itinerant Loom members who travel between regions resolving crises, settling disputes, and spreading stewardship practices.

### **Methods**

The Loom employs a balance of ritual work, diplomacy, and quiet sabotage.

- **Wild-Magic Shaping:** They guide bloom zones to prevent explosive growth from overwhelming settlements.
- **Ecosystem Mediation:** They negotiate between governments and ecological realities, ensuring rivers aren’t diverted, forests aren’t overharvested, and migration routes stay open.
- **Direct Intervention:** When persuasion fails, Loom agents may sabotage destructive constructs or machinery.
- **Interspecies Councils:** They maintain ties between humanoids, beastfolk, awakened creatures, and druidic spirits.

### **Goals**

- **Short-Term:** Stabilize rising bloom zones near the Inner Sea, repair forest corridors broken by frontier expansion, and counter aggressive clear-cutting in southern Greenwood.
- **Long-Term:** Rebuild the continental ley-grove network—a system of natural anchors maintaining magical stability—and heal the Silent Hollows where magic still dies.

### **Relationships**

- **Allies:** The Veilbound Choir (shared focus on continuity and healing), Tide-Sunder Covenant (cooperative on hazard containment).
- **Tense:** Iron Compact (disputes over technological expansion and land use).
- **Rivals:** Emberlight Pact (philosophical conflict: stability vs. disruption), expansionist powers.

### **Adventure Hooks**

- A bloom engulfing a border region threatens to absorb a village overnight.
- A Wandersib uncovers poisoning of a sacred river by industrial runoff.
- A Seed-Cairn is destabilized by a resurfaced OCE ley-engine.

---

# **2. The Iron Compact**

### **Type:** Technocratic reconstruction and stabilization order

### **Domains:** Infrastructure, logistics, safety protocol, continuity of civilization

### **Pantheon Resonance:** Arturion (craft), Lorynthos (law), Basturion (steadfast protection)

### **Regions:** Inner Sea rim, Selrya, Lakelands academies, Redspine passes, Dawnwall trade routes

### **Summary**

Where the Verdant Loom tends the land, the Iron Compact tends civilization. This faction views the continent as an interconnected system of roads, bridges, ley-relays, and civic frameworks that must never collapse again. Their central thesis: **civilization is stable only when its infrastructure is stable.** Every failed road is a famine. Every unstable ley conduit is a disaster. Every unregulated magical experiment risks a repeat of the Shattering.

### **Origins & Shattering Legacy**

- **Late-OCE Guild Roots:** The Compact formed from late-imperial engineering guilds, arcano-legal councils, and civic magistrates who recognized empire-scale decay.
- **During the Shattering:** They attempted (and failed) to seal collapsing ley conduits and waygates, but their records of these failures remain invaluable.
- **During the Silence:** Compact enclaves preserved foundational knowledge—blueprints, measurements, arcane safety protocols—and taught communities how to maintain critical structures without magic.

### **Structure**

- **Chain of Nine:** Senior architects and logisticians who define continent-wide standards.
- **Regional Prefects:** Administrators charged with overseeing reconstruction and mediation.
- **Circuitwardens:** Inspectors traveling between regions enforcing safety standards.
- **Reliquarists:** Scholars responsible for cataloging and securing dangerous pre-OCE artifacts.

### **Methods**

- **Standardization:** Unifying measurements, road widths, weights, tariffs, and civic laws.
- **Reconstruction:** Deploying teams to repair major roads and ley-relay towers.
- **Hazard Mitigation:** Identifying unstable relics or magic-nodes and instituting safety perimeters.
- **Legal Mediation:** Intervening in disputes threatening trade networks or public safety.

### **Goals**

- **Short-Term:** Reinforce ley grid stability around the Inner Sea, curb technomantic excess in Selrya, and stabilize failing Redspine passes.
- **Long-Term:** Restore a continent-wide non-imperial network of transit and communication; secure or neutralize all catastrophic OCE relics.

### **Relationships**

- **Allies:** Tide-Sunder Covenant (shared threat modeling), Veilbound Choir (shared focus on continuity).
- **Tense:** Verdant Loom (clashes over ecological costs), Crownless Assembly (politics of authority).
- **Rivals:** Emberlight Pact (destruction of stability), dynastic remnants.

### **Adventure Hooks**

- A ley tower begins emitting harmonic vibrations—an imminent collapse.
- A Circuitwarden uncovers corruption involving sabotage of public works.
- A buried OCE transport node reactivates beneath a trade route.

# **3. The Veilbound Choir**

### **Type:** Esoteric dream-memory custodial order

### **Domains:** Dreams, ancestral memory, healing of psychic wounds, truth preservation

### **Pantheon Resonance:** Umbrayel (memory), Omyr (truth), Thalvyr (omens)

### **Regions:** Lakeland river mists, Greenwood dream-groves, Inner Sea ruins, Frontier barrows

### **Summary**

The Veilbound Choir safeguards Casmoran’s collective memory and psychic health. They walk the threshold between dreams and waking, preserving ancestral knowledge, decoding prophetic nightmares, and healing communities traumatized by centuries of upheaval. To them, forgetting the past is the most dangerous act imaginable.

### **Origins & Shattering Legacy**

- **Pre-OCE Roots:** Dreamkeepers tended ancestral memory long before recorded history.
- **During the Shattering:** Nightmares became prophetic horrors; Choir cells preserved visions that warned survivors where to flee.
- **During the Silence:** They collected testimonies and genealogies, storing them in memory-crypts and echo-shrines.

### **Structure**

- **Lantern-Cantors:** Elders who maintain memory-galleries.
- **Dreamweavers:** Practitioners who guide communal dreams.
- **Remembrancers:** Historians of lived experience.
- **Horizon-Walkers:** Vision-seekers who interpret omens.
- **Moonbinders:** Specialists in ancestral communion.

### **Methods**

- Conducting dream-circles to heal communal trauma.
- Intervening in regions afflicted by nightmare storms.
- Preserving ancestral memory in crypts and dream-groves.
- Extracting truths hidden within multi-generational dream-echoes.

### **Goals**

- **Short-Term:** Investigate rising nightmare patterns emerging across the Inner Sea.
- **Long-Term:** Establish a continent-wide dream-path network anchoring psychic stability.

### **Relationships**

- **Allies:** Verdant Loom, Iron Compact
- **Tense:** Crownless Assembly (danger of weaponized truth), Tide-Sunder Covenant
- **Rivals:** Emberlight radicals, dynastic states hiding uncomfortable history

### **Adventure Hooks**
