# **Section C — Player Guide: Choosing Your Lineage in Casmoran**
This section helps players **build a character that feels native** to Casmoran while staying mechanically simple.

---
## **C1. Step 1 — Pick Your Species**
Ask:
- What *role* do you want to play?  
- What *tone* fits that?  
- Do you want to be tied to a specific faction or region?

**General guidance:**
- **Humans** → flexibility and political depth.
- **Elves** → lore, memory, spiritual resonance.
- **Dwarves** → infrastructure, honor, stability.
- **Gnomes** → creativity, chaos, spark.
- **Halflings** → social glue, mobility, cheerful resilience.
- **Orcs/Half-Orcs** → conviction, strength, trials.
- **Beastfolk** → primal identity and biome-shaped culture.

---
## **C2. Step 2 — Choose Your Biome Lineage**
This determines **cultural identity**, not mechanics.

Questions to ask:
- Were you raised in forests? Mountains? Stormlands? Cities?
- What shaped your worldview—community, trials, trade, survival?

Biome = your personal backstory’s backbone.

---
## **C3. Step 3 — Decide if You Are Planar-Touched**
If yes, pick from the **Sevenfold**.  
This adds **flavor**, not major power spikes.

### Best choices by archetype:
- **Visionary / healer / mystic** → Twilight-Touched
- **Troubled prodigy / chaotic magic** → Riftborne
- **Warrior / scout / storm-walker** → Storm-Touched
- **Druid / monk / sailor** → Tideborn
- **Ranger / primal caster** → Bloom-Touched
- **Warden / frost mage / barbarian** → Frostborne
- **Lore-seeker / anomalous arrival** → Leyborne

---
## **C4. Highlight: Leyborne as Story Fuel**
If you choose **Leyborne**, you’re signaling:
- mysterious displacement,
- potential connection to pre-Shattering knowledge,
- inherent ties to the OCE collapse,
- possible factions watching or studying you.

Leyborne = *built-in plot arc*. Use it.

---
## **C5. Step 4 — Choose Your Faction or remain Unaligned**
Your lineage influences—but does not dictate—your faction.

If you want:
- **spiritual or dream focus:** Choir
- **ecology & balance:** Loom
- **infrastructure, order:** Compact
- **storms, trials, conviction:** Emberlight
- **coastal resilience, rifts:** Tide-Sunder
- **people-power & reform:** Assembly

---
## **C6. Step 5 — Finalize Personality & Story Hooks**
Ask:
- What does my biome lineage value?  
- How does my planar-touched status complicate life?  
- Which faction sees potential in me?  
- Which region(s) shaped my beliefs?  

These answers immediately anchor your character to Casmoran’s cultures.

# Casmoran Subspecies Lineages — Planar-Touched (Sevenfold Overlays)

Planar-Touched are **not separate species**. They are overlays—heritage signatures that can manifest in **any lineage** (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Gnome, Halfling, Orc/Half-Orc, Beastfolk). These overlays emerge when mortal bloodlines intersect with planar forces, Shattering phenomena, wild magic, or (uniquely) the collapse of the OCE portal lattice.

Each entry maps cleanly to a standard 5e/5.5e mechanical ancestry (Aasimar, Tiefling, or one of the four Genasi), but with **Casmoran-first flavor and lore**.

This document contains the complete, unified list of all seven.

Order:
8.1 Twilight-Touched (Aasimar Analog)
8.2 Riftborne (Tiefling Analog)
8.3 Storm-Touched (Air Genasi Analog)
8.4 Tideborn (Water Genasi Analog)
8.5 Bloom-Touched (Earth Genasi Analog)
8.6 Frostborne (Fire Genasi Analog — Inverted Cold Variant)
8.7 Leyborne (Unique Casmoran Overlay)

---

## **8.1 Twilight-Touched — Aasimar Analog**
**Linked Biomes:** Greenwood, Inner Sea, ancient ruins, places saturated with memory.

**Summary:** Twilight-Touched individuals resonate with the **dreamfold**, the liminal realm where ancestral memories, omens, and emotional echoes intersect. Their presence carries a quiet gravity—subtle light, unnerving calm, or a sense of déjà vu in historical spaces.

**Signs:**
- Silver-sheened or reflective eyes.
- Shadow-soft luminance around hair or hands.
- Symbolic dreams that sometimes bleed into waking life.
- Intuitive sense for sacred or historical places.

**Cultural Notes:** Choir scholars consider them ideal dream-navigators. Rural communities may view them as blessed, unsettling, or both.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Veilbound Choir**: Highly valued for dreamway mapping.
- **Verdant Loom**: Occasionally sought to interpret historical grove-memory.

**Mechanical Notes:** Use **Aasimar** chassis; reflavor celestial features as dreamfold manifestations.

---

## **8.2 Riftborne — Tiefling Analog**
**Linked Biomes:** Inner Sea, Mountain faultlines, stabilized Shattering scars.

**Summary:** Born near a Shattering scar or during a reality-echo event, Riftborne individuals exist slightly **out of phase** with local time or probability. Their behavior and instincts can feel unnervingly prescient or discordant.

**Signs:**
- Brief shimmer or distortion at the edge of vision.
- Impeccable timing—arriving “just before” or “just after” key moments.
- Spells, abilities, or emotions syncing with environmental pulses.
- Occasional flickers of alternate possibilities.

**Cultural Notes:** Feared in superstitious regions; prized by factions that deal with anomalies.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Veilbound Choir**: Studies temporal memory echoes.
- **Tide-Sunder**: Monitors Riftborne for long-term stability markers.

**Mechanical Notes:** Use **Tiefling** chassis; reflavor fiendish elements as probability/temporal anomalies.

---

## **8.3 Storm-Touched — Air Genasi Analog**
**Linked Biomes:** Highlands, Coast, Inner Sea storm belts.

**Summary:** Storm-Touched individuals are born during elemental anomalies—lightning that bends unnaturally, winds that carry voices, pressure drops that defy physics. They are kinetic, restless, and charged with sky-energy.

**Signs:**
- Hair that shifts with static or lifts in high emotion.
- Reflective irises during storms.
- Subtle ozone scent.
- Innate ease with high winds, heights, and rapid motion.

**Cultural Notes:** Seen as storm-heralds or trial-walkers.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Emberlight Pact**: Ideal candidates for trial rites.
- **Tide-Sunder**: Stationed at storm-rift watchposts.

**Mechanical Notes:** Use **Air Genasi** chassis; reflavor lightning/air traits with storm resonance.

---

## **8.4 Tideborn — Water Genasi Analog**
**Linked Biomes:** Coast, Basin, Inner Sea.

**Summary:** Tideborn carry echoes of **planar tides**—the subtle gravitational and emotional pull of water across worlds. They read currents, storms, and floods with uncanny instinct.

**Signs:**
- Blue-green highlights in hair or skin.
- Eyes that reflect ambient light like shallow water.
- Faint scent of brine or clean river.
- Emotional states often synchronized with weather patterns.

**Cultural Notes:** Tideborn are often seen as omens—good or ill.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Tide-Sunder**: Coastal rift monitoring.
- **Mirethiel Clergy**: Tide rites, flood relief, water-blessing traditions.

**Mechanical Notes:** Use **Water Genasi** chassis.

---

## **8.5 Bloom-Touched — Earth Genasi Analog**
**Linked Biomes:** Greenwood, Basin, Inner Sea gardens.

**Summary:** Bloom-Touched are influenced by **flora-aspected wild magic**—bloomfields, enchanted seed-wards, or druidic rituals. Their lives intertwine with growth, emotion, and cycles.

**Signs:**
- Petal-patterned birthmarks.
- Subtle scent of leaves, pollen, or fresh soil.
- Harmless wild-magic flares triggered by strong emotion.
- Plants subtly lean toward them.

**Cultural Notes:** Loom circles watch them with equal parts reverence and caution.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Verdant Loom**: Primary oversight.
- **Veilbound Choir**: Tracks dream-flora resonance.

**Mechanical Notes:** Use **Earth Genasi** chassis; reflavor stone/earth abilities as flora-based.

---

## **8.6 Frostborne — Fire Genasi Analog (Cold-Reflavored)**
**Linked Biomes:** Northern tundra, glacial ranges, mountain altitudes.

**Summary:** Frostborne channel the power of the **cold plane**, an inverted analog to the fire-aligned elemental realms. Born during glacial anomalies or winter-spirit convergence, they embody endurance, clarity, and entropy-touched magic.

**Signs:**
- Pale or ice-blue skin tones.
- Cold breath in mild weather.
- Hoarfrost on eyebrows or hair during emotion spikes.
- Aura that chills the air subtly.

**Cultural Notes:** Often woven into northern myths or giant-kin sagas.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Tide-Sunder**: Investigates deep-freeze rifts.
- **Veilbound Choir**: Tracks winter-memory patterns.

**Mechanical Notes:** Use **Fire Genasi** chassis, but swap all heat/fire features for cold/ice equivalents.

---

## **8.7 Leyborne — Unique Casmoran Overlay**
**Linked Biomes:** Inner Sea, Mountains, anywhere containing ruined OCE infrastructure.

**Summary:** Leyborne are the **wildcards of Casmoran’s history**—individuals who arrived (or whose ancestors arrived) during the catastrophic collapse of the OCE portal lattice. When the network failed, countless beings were displaced:
- torn from transit mid-journey,
- scattered across worlds,
- or forcibly anchored in Casmoran as portals imploded.

Their bodies bear subtle, rhythmic echoes of the lattice itself.

**Signs:**
- Geometric or circuit-like facial symmetry.
- Rhythmic speech patterns.
- Intuitive understanding of spatial flow or structural stress.
- Disorientation when near unstable magic.

**Cultural Notes:** Leyborne ancestry is often kept private; stories vary between “blessed by the old gateways” and “marked by catastrophe.”

**Faction Influence:**
- **Iron Compact**: Values their spatial intuition.
- **Veilbound Choir**: Studies their memories of collapse-era transit.

**Mechanical Notes:** Leyborne can choose any Genasi variant mechanically, or a lightly modified Aasimar/Tiefling chassis depending on the nature of the displacement.

---

## **1.3 Coast Humans**
**Summary:** Coast Humans grow up amid salt winds, shifting tides, and mercantile cultures shaped by ports, storms, and seasonal migrations. They are adaptable, superstitious in a practical way, and fiercely loyal to harbor-kin.

**Physical Traits:** Sun-kissed skin, salt-stiff hair, sea-weathered features. Clothing favors oilcloth, layered wraps, and stormproof boots, often decorated with charms against drowning or bad luck.

**Culture:** Harbor councils, boat-families, and trade-charters define civic organization. Tide-omens and storm calendars guide fishing, travel, and festivals. Shipwreck stories and "who braved which storm" are social currency.

**History:** Descendants of Shattering-era coastal camps, storm refugee lines, and early Reconstruction shipwright enclaves. Many families keep fragments of hull-planks or storm-bells as heirlooms.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Tide-Sunder:** Revered for containing rifts and guiding storm responses.
- **Mirethiel clergy:** Trusted for tide-blessings and safe-crossing rites.
- **Crownless Assembly:** Active in ports resisting monopolistic trade houses and predatory tariffs.

**Perceptions:** Viewed as bold, opportunistic, and lucky—or reckless and storm-drunk, depending on who you ask.

---

## **1.4 Inner Sea Humans**
**Summary:** Inner Sea Humans are cosmopolitan, adaptive, and deeply intertwined with centuries of trade, scholarship, conflict, and magical recovery. They are shaped by crossroads living, where cultures, factions, and ideas collide daily.

**Physical Traits:** Extremely varied; clothing blends practical travel gear with civic fashion, often marked by guild colors, city badges, or faction symbols.

**Culture:** City-state councils, trade leagues, arcane schools, communal festivals, and faction-aligned neighborhoods. Civic pride and political awareness run high; people tend to know not just their neighbors, but their neighbors’ allegiances.

**History:** Heirs to the Shattering’s epicenter, Reconstruction’s first alliances, and the continual reinvention of arcane infrastructure. Many families have stories tied to specific battles, treaties, or urban reforms.

**Faction Influence:** All major factions operate openly here, but:
- **Veilbound Choir** and **Iron Compact** are especially entrenched.
- **Crownless Assembly** and **Emberlight Pact** maintain influential cells.

**Perceptions:** Resourceful, politically savvy, occasionally overconfident and jaded.

---

## **1.5 Highlands Humans**
**Summary:** Highlands Humans are shaped by vast mesas, open skies, and storm-forged landscapes of the Plateau. Life here demands endurance, adaptability, and a philosophy centered on personal and communal trials.

**Physical Traits:** Sun-hardened skin, windswept hair, lean muscular frames. Clothing leans toward leathers, stormproof cloaks, layered wraps, and talismans marking completed trials.

**Culture:** Clan-roaming caravans, open-air rites, sky-fast competitions, ember trials, and tight-knit hearth-circles. Songs and tattoos often commemorate how a person met their greatest test.

**History:** Many families descend from nomadic bands that followed megafauna across the Plateau during the Silence, moving with storms and herds instead of borders.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Emberlight Pact:** Dominant philosophical resonance, framing trials as spiritual tempering.
- **Tide-Sunder:** Maintains stormwatch posts where Plateau storms intersect rift zones.

**Perceptions:** Passionate, resilient, intimidatingly direct. Known for respecting strength of conviction more than birth or title.

---

## **1.6 Greenwood Humans**
**Summary:** Greenwood Humans grow up beneath ancient trunks, bloom-wild groves, and druidic customs that predate their own recorded history. They are defined by coexistence with forces older and stranger than their villages.

**Physical Traits:** Earthy tones in skin and hair; green or hazel eyes are common. Clothing favors leathers, barkcloth, and plant-dyed fabrics in natural palettes.

**Culture:** Small, semi-isolated communities with strong ritual calendars. Loom circles and local wise-folk often guide major decisions. Storytelling, seasonal observances, and negotiated coexistence with the forest take priority over formal law.

**History:** Many lines descend from Silence-era refugees who sought shelter in the forests and were absorbed into Loom-guided communities. Their histories emphasize resilience, restraint, and the cost of cutting too deeply.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Verdant Loom:** Primary cultural influence, from agriculture to justice.
- **Veilbound Choir:** Present through ancestral dream traditions and memory rites.

**Perceptions:** Seen as mystical, serene, and deeply attuned to the uncanny—sometimes "too" comfortable with things others fear.

---

## **1.7 Planar-Touched Overlays (Sevenfold Canon)**

The following planar-touched overlays can manifest in **Humans** (as in any Casmoran lineage). For full mechanical details, use the standard Aasimar / Tiefling / Genasi options reskinned as below, and refer to the dedicated Planar-Touched document.

- **Twilight-Touched (Aasimar analog):** Dreamfold resonance, omen-lit presence, ancestral memory echoes.
- **Riftborne (Tiefling analog):** Shattering-scar instability, uncanny timing, probability slippage rather than fiendish blood.
- **Storm-Touched (Air Genasi analog):** Lightning and wind affinity, storm-charged aura, ease with heights and rapid movement.
- **Tideborn (Water Genasi analog):** Instinctive feel for tides, currents, and floods; sea-and-river attunement.
- **Bloom-Touched (Earth Genasi analog):** Flora-focused wild magic, growth surges, subtle plant resonance instead of bare stone.
- **Frostborne (Fire Genasi analog, cold-refit):** Cold-plane inversion of fire traits—hoarfrost aura, ice-aspected resilience and magic.
- **Leyborne (Unique Casmoran overlay):** Descendants or survivors of the OCE portal lattice collapse, marked by geometric features and spatial/structural intuition; metaphysically displaced into Casmoran rather than native-born planar ties.

## **7.7 Planar-Touched Overlays (Applicability to Beastfolk)**

Beastfolk of any strain (River-Clans, Wildclades, Tideclades, Stoneclades, Stormclades, Crossroads Clades) can also manifest **planar-touched overlays**. These do not create new Beastfolk species; they layer the Sevenfold planar signatures onto existing beastfolk cultures.

Common combinations include:
- **Storm-Touched Tideclades** riding hurricane fronts.
- **Bloom-Touched Wildclades** tied to bloomfronts and druidic groves.
- **Riftborne Crossroads Clades** born near Inner Sea scars.
- **Leyborne Beastfolk** whose ancestors were displaced into Casmoran during OCE lattice collapse.

Mechanically, use the same Sevenfold options (Twilight-Touched, Riftborne, Storm-Touched, Tideborn, Bloom-Touched, Frostborne, Leyborne) as with any other species, flavored through the relevant beast-totem and biome.
