# Casmoran Pantheon Wheel – GM Toolkit Edition (v1.0)
### *A structural guide to divine relationships, metaphysical axes, and cosmological balance*

This document is designed for **GM-side use inside the Worldforge GPT knowledge layer**.  
It provides a **functional, system-agnostic cosmogram** of the Casmoran pantheon that the GPT can use for:
- interpreting divine conflicts
- generating lore-consistent responses
- grounding regional cultures
- designing quests, prophecies, and divine interventions
- maintaining internal cosmological consistency

This is not a full deity compendium—only the **relational skeleton** of the pantheon.

---
# I. Pantheon Structure Overview
The Casmoran pantheon consists of **three concentric rings**:

- **Inner Ring — Elder Powers** (primordial, foundational, natural forces)
- **Middle Ring — Concordants + Umbrayel** (civilization, mediation, culture)
- **Outer Ring — Outer Walkers** (cosmic pressure, instability, entropy)

This structure governs how divine influence flows into the Material Plane.

# III. Inner Ring – The Elder Powers (Primordial Forces)
These four gods anchor reality. They sit closest to the "center" of the wheel and represent foundational natural forces.

### **North — Thalvyr, the Sky-Seer**
Wind, storms, freedom, prophecy.

### **West — Vharûn, the World-Anvil**
Stone, endurance, craft, mountains.

### **South — Aerathwyn, the Verdant Mother**
Wild growth, cycles, beasts, predator–prey balance.

### **East — Mirethiel, the River-Steward**
Flowing waters, renewal, migration, tides.

**Inner Ring = Stability + Natural Cycles + Physical Reality**

---
# IV. Middle Ring – Civilization & Mediation
These gods shape mortal society, culture, and institutions.

### **East-Northeast — Lorynthos, the Wordkeeper**
Knowledge, history, law.

### **Southeast — Tessimir, the Coin-Turner**
Commerce, travel, opportunity, chance.

### **South — Emberith, the Flame of Ambition**
Passion, transformation, rebellion, creation-through-destruction.

### **Southwest — Basturion, the Shieldbearer**
Protection, unity, oaths, guardianship.

### **West-Northwest — Arturion, the Maker of Ways**
Invention, engineering, construction, infrastructure.

### **Center-Northwest — Umbrayel, the Night Shepherd**
Gentle death, dreams, memory, transition.  
**Position:** Slightly inward, functioning as the moderator between all rings.

**Middle Ring = Mortality, Culture, Constructed Order**

---
# V. Outer Ring – The Outer Walkers (Cosmic Extremes)
These entities are not destructive on purpose; they are *fundamental forces* that erode, pressure, or expose reality.

### **North — Zephrix, the Planewrecker**
Planar instability, rifts, wild magic.

### **Northeast — Omyr, the Truth-Seeker**
Revelation, harsh clarity, exposed secrets.

### **Northwest — Yhesseth, the Unraveler**
Entropy, decay, anti-magic, oblivion.

**Outer Ring = Cosmic Pressure + Existential Threat + Unmediated Truth**

---
# VI. Pantheon Axes (GM-Usable Alignment Structure)
These axes let GPT interpret divine tension or harmony logically.

## **1. Stability ↔ Chaos Axis (West ↔ East)**
- **Vharûn → Basturion/Arturion → stability, structure, endurance**
- **Mirethiel → Tessimir/Omyr → flow, flexibility, revelation**

GM Use: When plots involve law, civil order, long-term building, or institutional collapse.

---
## **2. Life ↔ Ending Axis (South ↔ North)**
- **Aerathwyn → Emberith/Tessimir → growth, transformation**
- **Umbrayel → Zephrix/Yhesseth → endings, rupture, dissolution**

GM Use: When stories involve rebirth, extinction, death-rites, or finality.

---
## **3. Reality ↔ The Beyond Axis (Center ↔ Outer Edge)**
- **Inner Ring:** literal physics/ecology of Casmoran
- **Middle Ring:** culture & civilization
- **Outer Ring:** pressure from planes, entropy, truth

GM Use: When deciding the magnitude or nature of divine intervention.

---
# VII. Functional Divine Clusters
Grouping the gods by function helps the GPT maintain consistent divine behavior.

### **A. Elemental Quadrangle (Inner Ring)**
- Vharûn (stone)
- Aerathwyn (life)
- Mirethiel (water)
- Thalvyr (sky)

Primary influence: stability, ecosystems, elemental events.

### **B. Civilization Triad (Middle Ring)**
- Lorynthos (law/record)
- Basturion (protection/order)
- Arturion (infrastructure)

Primary influence: cities, governance, long-term stability.

### **C. Motion & Change Triad**
- Tessimir (trade/flow)
- Emberith (ambition/transformation)
- Thalvyr (freedom/change)

Primary influence: travel, upheaval, societal evolution.

### **D. Cataclysmic Triad (Outer Ring)**
- Zephrix (instability)
- Omyr (revelation)
- Yhesseth (entropy)

Primary influence: planar events, magical anomalies, existential threats.

---
# VIII. The Role of Umbrayel (Central Mediator)
Umbrayel is the pivot-point of the pantheon:

- Mediates **Inner ↔ Middle** (life/death cycles)
- Softens **Outer Ring influence** (entropy, truth, instability)
- Prevents schisms between Elder Powers and Concordants

In narrative terms:  
**Umbrayel is the deity invoked when tensions escalate between rings.**

---
# IX. How GPT Should Use the Wheel (GM Logic Framework)

### **1. Consistent Divine Voice & Behavior**
Each god’s influence should reflect its ring and axis position.
- Outer Walkers: extreme, impersonal, high stakes.
- Elder Powers: natural, enduring, cyclic.
- Concordants: practical, societal, relationship-centered.

### **2. Prophecy & Omens**
- North omens → storms, change, endings, instability.
- South omens → growth, passion, transformation.
- East omens → knowledge, trade, truth.
- West omens → stone, law, craft, protection.

### **3. Regional Variants**
Regions aligned to:
- **West:** fortresses, craft guilds, oaths (Vharûn, Basturion)
- **South:** forests, wilds, artistic cities (Aerathwyn, Emberith)
- **East:** trade hubs, archives, coastal powers (Mirethiel, Lorynthos, Tessimir)
- **North:** highlands, rift-zones, prophetic tribes (Thalvyr, Zephrix, Omyr)

### **4. Adventure Generation Model**
When building quests, use the wheel to align stakes:
- Opposed deities → conflict arcs
- Adjacent deities → cooperative or thematic synergy
- Outer ring influence → crisis-level events
- Middle ring influence → political/religious tensions
- Inner ring influence → natural phenomena, ancient sites

# XII. Divine Conflict Matrix (GM-Focused)
This matrix outlines **predictable friction points** between deities. Use these to drive divine tension, faction disputes, omens, and story arcs.

Conflicts fall into four categories:
- **AXIAL** — inevitable due to position on the wheel.
- **DOMAIN** — competing authority in overlapping spheres.
- **PHILOSOPHICAL** — worldview opposition.
- **HISTORICAL** — past clashes from the Shattering or Silence.

Below is the structured conflict map.

---
## **A. Inner Ring Conflicts (Primordial Tensions)**
**Vharûn ↔ Thalvyr** — *Axial*  
Stone vs storm. Stability vs change.

**Aerathwyn ↔ Vharûn** — *Domain*  
Overgrowth vs constructed foundation.

**Mirethiel ↔ Aerathwyn** — *Philosophical*  
Flow vs territorial nature.

**Thalvyr ↔ Mirethiel** — *Elemental*  
Storms reshape rivers; rivers carve storm-battered land.

These conflicts are never malicious—just **nature in negotiation with itself**.

---
## **B. Middle Ring Conflicts (Civilization Tensions)**
**Basturion ↔ Emberith** — *Philosophical* (ORDER ↔ FREEDOM)  
Law vs rebellion; unity vs self-expression.

**Lorynthos ↔ Emberith** — *Domain*  
Stable narrative vs radical reinterpretation.

**Tessimir ↔ Basturion** — *Economic*  
Free movement vs regulated stability.

**Arturion ↔ Aerathwyn** — *Cross-Ring Domain*  
Construction vs wild reclaiming.

**Lorynthos ↔ Omyr** — *Truth*  
Recorded truth vs revealed truth.

---
## **C. Outer Ring Conflicts (Cosmic Threat Zones)**
**Zephrix ↔ Yhesseth** — *Philosophical*  
Instability vs total dissolution.

**Omyr ↔ Zephrix** — *Domain*  
Revelation vs chaotic distortion.

**Omyr ↔ Yhesseth** — *Existential*  
Truth preserved vs truth erased.

These conflicts shape planar disasters, rift-storms, and entropy outbreaks.

---
## **D. Inner ↔ Middle Cross-Ring Conflicts**
**Vharûn ↔ Arturion** — *Craft Lineage Debate*  
Old craft vs new invention.

**Aerathwyn ↔ Basturion** — *Civilization Encroachment*  
Wild lands vs fortified borders.

**Thalvyr ↔ Lorynthos** — *Epistemology*  
Revelation through change vs preservation through text.

**Mirethiel ↔ Tessimir** — *Flow vs Commerce*  
Natural flow vs economic flow.

---
## **E. Middle ↔ Outer Cross-Ring Conflicts**
**Basturion ↔ Zephrix** — *Direct Opposition*  
Order vs planar instability.

**Lorynthos ↔ Yhesseth** — *Recorded Knowledge vs Decay*  
Archivists vs oblivion.

**Arturion ↔ Yhesseth** — *Constructs vs Entropy*  
Infrastructure vs unmaking.

**Tessimir ↔ Omyr** — *Negotiation vs Truth*  
Flexible deals vs uncompromising clarity.

**Emberith ↔ Zephrix** — *Transformative Fire vs Chaos Storm*  
Creation-through-destruction vs meaningless destruction.

---
## **F. Inner ↔ Outer Cross-Ring Conflicts**
**Vharûn ↔ Zephrix** — *Foundations vs Fractures*  
Mountains vs planar rupture.

**Aerathwyn ↔ Yhesseth** — *Life vs Entropy*  
Living cycle vs total end.

**Thalvyr ↔ Omyr** — *Sky-Prophecy vs Blinding Truth*  
Freedom-insight vs harsh, static revelation.

**Mirethiel ↔ Yhesseth** — *Flow vs Stillness*  
Cycles vs stagnation.

---
## **G. Umbrayel’s Unique Conflict Web**
Umbrayel rarely initiates conflict but is central to many:

- **Umbrayel ↔ Yhesseth** — gentle passage vs oblivion.  
- **Umbrayel ↔ Zephrix** — peaceful transition vs catastrophic rupture.  
- **Umbrayel ↔ Emberith** — acceptance vs upheaval.  
- **Umbrayel ↔ Omyr** — compassion vs painful revelation.

These tensions fuel dream-omens, death rituals, and memory-loss phenomena.

---
## **H. Conflict Intensity Guide (GM Usage)**
Use this table to weight how severe a deity-versus-deity clash is likely to be.

| Conflict Type | Severity | Notes |
|---------------|----------|-------|
| Axial | ★★★★☆ | Fundamental, shapes eras |
| Domain | ★★★☆☆ | Frequent but manageable |
| Philosophical | ★★☆☆☆ | Cultural rather than cosmic |
| Historical | ★★★★☆ | Tied to Shattering or Silence |
| Elemental | ★★☆☆☆ | Natural balancing |
| Existential | ★★★★★ | Campaign-scale threats |

# XIII. GM Application Notes
Use divine conflict to drive:
- **regional tensions**
- **faction schisms**
- **omens & prophecies**
- **environmental anomalies**
- **divine interventions**
- **campaign arcs involving planar instability or entropy**

Divine conflict rarely means “god vs god” directly—more often it manifests as:

# XIV. Divine Influence on Hazards & Travel

The gods do not merely inspire narrative; their domains directly influence environmental hazards, travel difficulty, and the stability of magic across Casmoran. Use the following profiles to adjust hazard DCs, magic stability, or travel conditions whenever a deity’s presence is invoked, worshipped, or opposed. These guidelines complement the generic frameworks in the GM Screen and the regional overlays in Casmoran’s macro‑regions and biomes.

## Per‑Deity Profiles

### Aerathwyn – Verdant Mother
- **Domain Hazards:** Amplifies wild‑growth hazards; mitigates environmental plant hazards.
- **Region Bias:** Strong influence in **Greenwood**, **Southern Greenwood Arc**, and forested areas of the **Basin**.
- **Effects:** Travel through dense forests becomes smoother under her blessing (reduce travel difficulty by one step); wild‑magic blooms become more stable.
- **Boons & Omens:** Sudden blossoms or animal guides pointing toward safe paths indicate Aerathwyn’s favor. Invoking her may grant advantage on **Survival** checks to find shelter or forage.

### Arturion – Maker of Ways
- **Domain Hazards:** Mitigates structural hazards (collapsing ruins, bridge failures) and guides through engineered environments.
- **Region Bias:** Prominent in **Southwestern Basin**, **Redspine Mountains**, and any region with major infrastructure.
- **Effects:** Travelers may ignore the first structural hazard encountered; travel difficulty on maintained roads is reduced.
- **Boons & Omens:** A subtle humming of stone or the sudden illumination of ancient markers signal Arturion’s aid. Invoking him grants advantage on **Investigation** checks to detect structural weaknesses.

### Basturion – Shieldbearer
- **Domain Hazards:** Reduces social and political hazards; fortifies camps against attacks.
- **Region Bias:** Common in **Northwestern Frontier**, fortified settlements, and communal holds across Casmoran.
- **Effects:** Rest safety tier improves by one category in Basturion’s sanctified spaces; hazard frequency decreases near oath‑stones.
- **Boons & Omens:** Discovery of carved shields or oath‑stones signifies Basturion’s presence. Oath‑bound travelers may add +2 to defense against ambushes.

### Emberith – Flame of Ambition
- **Domain Hazards:** Amplifies hazards tied to passion and transformation (fires, rebellions); mitigates cold and stagnation.
- **Region Bias:** Influential in **Bronze Plateau / Eastern Steppe**, creative enclaves in **Southern Greenwood**, and anywhere change is embraced.
- **Effects:** Heat‑based hazards may intensify; cold‑climate travel difficulty drops by one step. Emberith’s favor can turn a failed hazard check into a partial success with a cost.
- **Boons & Omens:** Flickering lights or inexplicable warmth indicate Emberith’s eye. Invocations may allow rerolling a failed **Constitution** save at the cost of gaining Exhaustion.

### Lorynthos – Wordkeeper
- **Domain Hazards:** Mitigates knowledge‑related hazards (ancient puzzles, mystical traps); warns of arcane anomalies.
- **Region Bias:** Strong in **North‑Central Lakelands** colleges and archives, and wherever laws or libraries dominate.
- **Effects:** When Lorynthos is honored, hazard detection becomes easier (advantage on **Perception** and **Arcana** to spot threats). Travel difficulty in civilized areas decreases.
- **Boons & Omens:** Whispers of forgotten words or the spontaneous appearance of script herald Lorynthos’ favor. A quick prayer may reduce magic instability by one step.

### Mirethiel – River‑Steward
- **Domain Hazards:** Controls water‑borne hazards (floods, currents); calms storms but may amplify tides.
- **Region Bias:** Dominant along **Southeastern Peninsulas**, **North‑Central Lakelands**, and any major waterways.
- **Effects:** Travelers navigating rivers gain advantage on **Athletics** or **Vehicle (water)** checks; hazard frequency on waterways decreases.
- **Boons & Omens:** Unseasonal rainbows or calm waters signal her blessing. Offerings may shift a hazard’s intensity down a category.

### Omyr – Truth‑Seeker
- **Domain Hazards:** Exposes hidden dangers; increases the severity of secrets‑based social hazards.
- **Region Bias:** Prominent in **Dawnwall Highlands** hermit‑orders and sites of revelation.
- **Effects:** Magical and planar hazards tied to truth or revelation may intensify; however, Omyr’s insight grants advantage on saves versus illusion or deception.
- **Boons & Omens:** Sudden clarity or prophetic dreams indicate Omyr’s involvement. Invoking him grants +2 to checks to interpret omens but may attract additional hazards.

### Tessimir – Coin‑Turner
- **Domain Hazards:** Influences travel, trade, and chance. Mitigates hazards related to commerce and introduces opportunities within hazards.
- **Region Bias:** Everywhere trade flows, notably **Southeastern Peninsulas**, **Bronze Plateau**, and **North‑Central Lakelands**.
- **Effects:** Travel difficulty decreases on well‑traveled routes; hazard checks on trade roads may transform into beneficial encounters.
- **Boons & Omens:** Shining coins or favorable winds indicate Tessimir’s presence. Invocations may convert one hazard roll into a random boon (DM discretion).

### Thalvyr – Sky‑Seer
- **Domain Hazards:** Controls wind and storm hazards; can both amplify and quell environmental extremes.
- **Region Bias:** Governs open skies — **Dawnwall Highlands**, **Bronze Plateau**, and coastal storm belts.
- **Effects:** Hazard intensity of storms can be increased or decreased based on Thalvyr’s favor; travel over open plains or sea benefits from reduced navigation DCs.
- **Boons & Omens:** Sudden clear skies or thunderclaps with no storm indicate Thalvyr’s touch. A prayer may change a storm’s trajectory in the party’s favor.

### Umbrayel – Night Shepherd
- **Domain Hazards:** Mediates between life and death hazards; softens extreme effects of planar and wild magic.
- **Region Bias:** Present wherever transitions occur — dreams, death rites, and borderlands; strong in **North‑Central Lakelands** and **Southern Greenwood**.
- **Effects:** Rest safety tier improves by one when sanctified to Umbrayel; hazardous dreams may offer insights instead of afflictions.
- **Boons & Omens:** Gentle breezes, unusual calm, or lucid dreams signal Umbrayel. Invoking him reduces exhaustion gained from hazards by one level.

### Vharûn – World‑Anvil
- **Domain Hazards:** Stabilizes structural and earth‑related hazards; intensifies stonefall and avalanche hazards when angered.
- **Region Bias:** Core of **Redspine Mountains** and mining regions across Casmoran.
- **Effects:** Hazard frequency in tunnels decreases; travel difficulty through mountainous terrain lowers with proper rituals. However, provoking Vharûn may trigger rockslides.
- **Boons & Omens:** Deep rumbles, resonant tones in stone indicate Vharûn. Offerings grant advantage on **Strength** checks to overcome environmental obstacles.

### Yhesseth – Unraveler
- **Domain Hazards:** Amplifies entropy, decay, and anti‑magic hazards; dismantles protections.
- **Region Bias:** Most active in the **Inner Sea / Heartland Basin** and dead‑magic pockets such as the **Southwestern Basin**.
- **Effects:** In Yhesseth’s presence, magic stability drops to **volatile**; hazard DCs increase by 2. Mitigation becomes more difficult.
- **Boons & Omens:** Sudden silence, darkness, or the withering of nearby life can foreshadow Yhesseth. Attempts to invoke the Unraveler may backfire but can unravel enemy enchantments.

### Zephrix – Planewrecker
- **Domain Hazards:** Causes planar rifts, wild magic surges, and unpredictable arcane storms.
- **Region Bias:** Rife across the **Inner Sea**, **Bronze Plateau**, and areas riddled with planar scars.
- **Effects:** Hazard frequency and intensity dramatically increase in Zephrix‑scarred zones; travel through such areas may require multiple checks per day. Magic stability becomes **severe**.
- **Boons & Omens:** Shimmering air, crackling energy, and flickering reality mark Zephrix’s presence. Invoking Zephrix might allow travelers to tap planar shortcuts but risks catastrophic misfires.

Use these profiles to adjust hazard and travel mechanics when characters invoke the gods, visit sacred sites, or experience divine omens. They extend the GM Screen hazard framework and Casmoran regional overlays with divine nuance.
