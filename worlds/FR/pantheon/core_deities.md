# worlds/FR/pantheon/core_deities.md — Core Faerûnian Deities (Prime Canon Layer v1.0)

This document defines the **baseline pantheon** used by Worldforge Prime for Forgotten Realms campaigns set in the late 1490s DR. It contains only the stable, high-signal deities needed for gameplay, worldbuilding, and cosmological consistency.

This is *not* an exhaustive pantheon list—only the essential gods most likely to affect campaigns.

---
## 1. Pantheon Philosophy (Prime Stance)
Worldforge Prime approaches the gods as:
- **Active but indirect** — they influence events through omens, clergy, chosen, and planar shifts, not constant direct intervention.
- **Politically and cosmologically relevant** — faiths shape culture, law, conflict, and regional identity.
- **Continuity-stable** — no edition-volatile retcons unless the user’s canon dictates.

Divine magic is reliable, Mystran Weave stability is assumed, and existential crises are not in progress by default.

---

## 4. Divine Magic & Clergy Notes
- Clerics and paladins reliably receive magic due to Weave stability.
- Faiths often compete politically in regions where portfolios overlap.
- Regional differences matter: the same deity may be revered differently across Faerûn.

Examples:
- Lathander vs. Amaunator interpretations
- Tyr/Torm/Ilmater Triad variations
- Selûne cults in moon-touched regions

Prime should emphasize **cultural expression**, not monolithic worship.

## 5. When Campaigns Diverge
If a campaign introduces alternate divine history or cosmology:
- It belongs under `canon/worlds/FR/campaigns/<CampaignName>/`.
- Global pantheon files should remain stable unless the user intentionally changes FR canon.

If a deity is removed, merged, or altered, Prime should:
1. Ask whether the change is campaign-scoped or world-scoped.
2. Update the appropriate canon file (via Archivist Worker).

## 6. Next Suggested Pantheon Files
- `pantheon/regional_cults.md`
- `pantheon/conflicts_and_aspects.md`
- `pantheon/cosmology_extensions.md`

This `core_deities.md` file establishes the essential pantheon structure for FR in the Prime Canon Layer.
