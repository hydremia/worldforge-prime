# worlds/FR/_index.md — Forgotten Realms Overview (Prime Canon Layer v1.0)

This document establishes the **baseline Forgotten Realms context** used by Worldforge Prime for Tier‑1 canon. It defines the version of the Realms Prime assumes when working in FR unless the user overrides it.

This is *not* an exhaustive Realms encyclopedia—only the stable, high‑signal foundations needed for consistent worldbuilding, campaign play, and Worker alignment.

---
## 1. Timeline & Era
Worldforge Prime defaults to the **late 1490s DR**, specifically:

**→ Primary temporal anchor: 1494–1495 DR**

This window is chosen because:
- The Realms have stabilized after the Second Sundering.
- Most major factions, cities, and power blocs are active and recognizable.
- It gives strong continuity with modern 5e-era material.
- It avoids the most volatile novel-driven metaplots.

Users may override the year, but this is the default assumption for FR world queries.

---
## 2. Tone & Canon Stance
The version of the Realms used here is:
- **Grounded high fantasy** — magic is present everywhere but marvel is contextual.
- **Politically alive** — cities, factions, and powers have motives and conflicts.
- **Adventurer-centric** — the world responds to heroes without revolving around them.
- **Continuity-stable** — avoids controversial or contradictory sourcebook retcons.

Prime assumes the world is:
- culturally diverse
- geopolitically active
- mythologically deep
- not static, but not in apocalyptic upheaval

---
## 3. Cosmology (Simplified)
Prime uses the post‑Sundering cosmology:
- **Material Plane**: Faerûn
- **Feywild & Shadowfell**: active, thin boundaries in some regions
- **Inner Planes**: elemental sources for magic and planar influence
- **Outer Planes**: aligned realms of gods, Celestials, Fiends

This cosmology is intentionally rules‑light; campaigns may adjust metaphysics.

---
## 4. Major Regions of Faerûn
Prime recognizes the following large-scale regions for structural purposes:
- **Sword Coast & Western Heartlands**
- **The North / Silver Marches**
- **The Dalelands**
- **The Moonsea**
- **Cormyr & The Heartlands**
- **Amn, Tethyr, Calimshan**
- **Chult**
- **Anauroch & The Old Empires**
- **Icewind Dale**
- **The Underdark** (treated as a multi-region, multi-layer structure)

Detailed breakdowns appear under `geography/`.

---
## 5. Key Factions
Commonly active and stable factions used in baseline FR continuity:
- **Harpers** – decentralized do‑good information network
- **Lords' Alliance** – political & military coalition of major cities
- **Zhentarim** – mercenary network with criminal & commercial arms
- **Emerald Enclave** – druidic / ranger natural balance guardians
- **Order of the Gauntlet** – militant holy order against fiendish/corrupt forces
- **Arcane Brotherhood** – Luskan‑based arcane cabal
- **Cult of the Dragon** – fractured, dragon‑focused conspiracies

Campaigns may promote or demote the activity of these groups.

---
## 6. Pantheon (High-Level)
Prime treats the Faerûnian pantheon as **active and responsive**, but typically indirect.
Prominent deities (not exhaustive):
- **Mystra** — magic, the Weave
- **Tyr** — justice
- **Lathander** — renewal, dawn
- **Chauntea** — agriculture, life
- **Tempus** — war
- **Selûne** — moon, prophecy, tides
- **Shar** — secrets, loss, shadow
- **Corellon** — elvenkind, arcana
- **Moradin** — creation, dwarves
- **Bane** — tyranny, conquest

Full deity lists appear under `pantheon/`.

---
## 7. Technology & Magic Level
Prime assumes:
- **Medieval baseline** technology with commonplace magical augmentation.
- **Wizards, clerics, druids, bards, artificers** are accepted social fixtures.
- **Magic items** exist but vary in rarity and legality.
- **Spellcasting** is regulated mainly by social/political power structures, not formal law.

---
## 8. Notable Metaplot Assumptions
Prime avoids volatile, edition-specific timelines. The following are assumed *resolved and stable*:
- The Sundering is complete.
- Mystra and the Weave are stable.
- No Realms-shaking crises are currently underway.

Campaigns may introduce new crises, but this baseline remains neutral.

---
## 9. Campaign Integration Notes
When a new campaign begins in FR:
- It should specify a region + tone + initial hook.
- It may override local politics or factions at any time.
- Any campaign-specific changes go in:
  `canon/worlds/FR/campaigns/<CampaignName>/`
- Major divergences from FR baseline should be documented there, not in the global files.

Prime uses this FR index as:
- a consistent reference point for improv
- a stable fallback when Archivist has no world data
- a baseline for Nomina naming (FR-specific cultures)

---
## 10. Next Steps for FR Canon
Suggested files to create next:
- `geography/overview.md`
- `factions/harpers.md`
- `pantheon/core_deities.md`
- Campaign-specific folders for active campaigns

This `_index.md` defines the structural and tonal foundation for FR within Worldforge Prime.
