# WORLD FORGE PRIME — GM SCREEN / RULES SPINE v1.1 (FULLY EXPANDED, 5.5e–ALIGNED)

**Purpose:**\
This module serves as the *authoritative rules spine* for Worldforge Prime. It contains all essential mechanical rulings, frameworks, adjudication logic, and system assumptions derived from the 2024/2025 revised D&D ruleset (commonly referred to as “5.5e”). The DM Toolbox and OPS rely on this document for consistent adjudication and rule validation, while Creative Tools reference it lightly to maintain mechanical coherence.

This expanded version is designed to be:

- Clear and human-readable
- Mechanically consistent and complete
- Neutral in tone and terminology
- Campaign‑agnostic (Tier‑1 overrides always take precedence)
- OPS‑verifiable
- Suitable for stable inclusion in the Knowledge Layer

---

# **0. SYSTEM FOUNDATIONS & RULE ASSUMPTIONS**

Prime uses the following baselines unless a campaign explicitly overrides them.

## **0.1 Ruleset**

- The 2024/2025 revised core D&D rules are the mechanical default.
- All classes follow the newest versions of: spell preparation, exhaustion, weapon mastery, class resource scaling, and class progression patterns.
- Familiar 2014 rules may appear in homebrew campaigns but do **not** override the default unless written into Tier‑1 Campaign Canon.

## **0.2 Terminology Standards**

- *d20 Test* encompasses: ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.
- *Modifier* refers to ability modifier + proficiency + situational bonuses.
- *Tier‑1 override* = campaign‑specific rules that supersede everything here.

## **0.3 Rest Structure**

- **Short Rest:** \~1 hour, limited recovery depending on class.
- **Long Rest:** \~8 hours, restores features, spell slots, and ability uses depending on class.

---

# **1. D20 TESTS, ABILITY CHECKS & SKILLS**

This section forms the backbone of moment‑to‑moment resolution.

## **1.1 Anatomy of a d20 Test**

A d20 Test is resolved as:

`d20 + Ability Modifier + Proficiency Bonus (if applicable) + Bonuses/Penalties`

Test types:

- **Ability Check** – general tasks and challenges.
- **Saving Throw** – resist harmful effects.
- **Attack Roll** – attempt to hit a target.

Prime automatically determines the correct category and modifier based on action context.

## **1.2 Difficulty Classes (DCs)**

Prime uses a consistent DC band unless overridden:

- **5:** Very Easy
- **10:** Easy / Routine
- **15:** Moderate (default for meaningful challenge)
- **20:** Hard
- **25:** Very Hard
- **30+:** Epic / near impossible

DCs may be modified by environment, opposing abilities, or tool proficiency.

## **1.3 Skill + Ability Pairings**

While listed pairs are defaults, Prime may use alternative pairings if narratively logical.

**Strength** – Athletics\
**Dexterity** – Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, Stealth\
**Constitution** – Endurance, pushing through hazards\
**Intelligence** – Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, Religion\
**Wisdom** – Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, Survival\
**Charisma** – Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion

Prime supports non‑traditional pairings, e.g., *Strength (Intimidation)* or *Intelligence (Acrobatics)* if fiction justifies it.

## **1.4 Advantage & Disadvantage**

- Advantage = roll 2d20, keep highest.
- Disadvantage = roll 2d20, keep lowest.
- They do not stack — one source of each cancels out.

## **1.5 Passive Scores**

Passive = 10 + mod + proficiency + bonuses.
Used for:

- Stealth detection
- Noticing environmental dangers
- Social intuition
- Travel navigation

## **1.6 Contested Checks**

Each side rolls; highest total wins. Ties preserve the current state.

Examples:

- Grappling vs escaping
- Persuasion vs Insight
- Stealth vs Passive Perception

## **1.7 Group Checks**

Used when a party acts together (e.g., stealthing as a group). Majority success = group success.

---

# **2. CONDITIONS & EXHAUSTION (2024 MODEL)**

Prime uses the updated condition framework.

## **2.1 Conditions Overview**

Core conditions include (but are not limited to):

- Blinded
- Charmed
- Deafened
- Frightened
- Grappled
- Incapacitated
- Invisible
- Paralyzed
- Poisoned
- Prone
- Restrained
- Stunned

Conditions apply their full listed effects until removed.

## **2.2 Exhaustion (Revised)**

The 2024 system replaces the old “skill penalties stacking randomly” with a clean progressive track.

**Exhaustion Level 1–10 (campaign may vary, default 1–6):**

- Each level imposes **–1 to all d20 Tests**.
- Each level reduces **speed by 5 ft**.
- At max level → death.
- One level removed at the end of a Long Rest.

Typical causes:

- Long forced marches
- Starvation/dehydration
- Harsh climates
- Certain spells/hazards

Prime enforces exhaustion more rigorously during survival‑focused campaigns.

---

# **3. COMBAT SYSTEM (EXPANDED)**

## \*\*3.1 Initiative & Rounds

- Each round = \~6 seconds.
- Initiative is rolled once per combat.
- Ties resolved by highest Dex mod or DM ruling.

## **3.2 Turn Economy**

Each creature receives:

- **Movement** up to its speed
- **One Action**
- **One Bonus Action** (if available)
- **One Reaction** (refreshes at creature’s turn)

## **3.3 Actions (Expanded List)**

- Attack (single or multiattack)
- Cast a spell
- Dash
- Dodge
- Disengage
- Help
- Hide
- Ready an action
- Search
- Use an Object
- Shove or Grapple

## **3.4 Opportunity Attacks**

Triggered when a creature *leaves* a hostile creature’s reach without disengaging or teleporting.

## **3.5 Critical Hits**

- Natural 20 → critical hit.
- Double weapon damage dice; class features may add more.

## **3.6 Damage Types**

Prime uses standard 5e damage types (bludgeoning, radiant, necrotic, thunder, etc.).

## **3.7 Death Saves**

- Roll d20 at start of turn when dying.
- 3 successes = stable.
- 3 failures = death.
- Nat 20 = regain 1 HP.
- Nat 1 = counts as 2 failures.

---

# **4. WEAPON MASTERY SYSTEM (FULLY EXPANDED)**

Weapon Mastery is a core martial feature in 2024/2025 rules.

## **4.1 Access by Class**

- Fighters: broad mastery access, may change preparations on long rests.
- Barbarians: moderate access, emphasizing forceful masteries.
- Rangers/Paladins: mixed but meaningful access.
- Rogues/Monks: selective access depending on subclass.

## **4.2 Mastery Properties (Definitions)**

**Cleave:** On hit, you may deal damage to another adjacent creature.

**Graze:** On a miss, you still deal a small amount of damage.

**Push:** Target must save or be pushed 5–10 ft.

**Topple:** Target must save or fall prone.

**Slow:** Target’s speed reduced by 10–15 ft until end of next turn.

**Sap:** Target suffers disadvantage on its next attack.

**Nick:** Grants a small chip‑damage rider or enables bonus action off‑hand play.

**Flex:** A weapon gains new behavior when wielded in one or two hands.

Campaigns may add custom properties through Tier‑1 Canon.

---

# **5. SPELLCASTING SYSTEM (UNIFIED PREPARATION MODEL)**

## **5.1 Universal Preparation Model**

All classes with spellcasting prepare spells:

- Prepared list resets on long rest.
- Casting expends slots, *not* prepared spells.

## **5.2 Spell Slots & Scaling**

- Slot levels range from 1st to 9th.
- Cantrips scale with total character level.
- Higher‑level slots may upcast many spells.

## **5.3 Concentration Rules**

- Only one concentration spell at a time.
- Taking damage → Con save.
- Losing concentration ends the effect.

## **5.4 Ritual Casting**

- Some spells may be cast without slot expenditure but require longer casting time.

## **5.5 Spell Components & Substitutions**

- V/S/M rules apply.
- Component pouches and focuses substitute for many M components.
- Expensive components must be tracked unless campaign abstracts them.

---

# **6. CLASS FEATURES & RESOURCE MODELS (EXPANDED)**

Prime uses reference patterns:

## **6.1 Martial Patterns**

- Action Surge‑style features with scaling uses.
- Multiple damage‑boosting or action‑modifying features.
- Rage or similar modes granting temporary increases.
- Weapon mastery interactions.

## **6.2 Caster Patterns**

- Signature features (Arcane Recovery, Channel Divinity, Wildshape, etc.).
- Progression tied strongly to spell slot development.
- Prepared spells scale with class level.

## **6.3 Hybrid Patterns**

- Mix martial offense + limited spell slots (Paladin, Ranger).
- Invocation‑like systems (Warlock).

---

# **7. EXPLORATION, TRAVEL & ENVIRONMENT (FULL EXPANSION)**

## **7.1 Travel Pace & Timekeeping**

- **Slow Pace:** Better stealth & perception; reduced distance.
- **Normal Pace:** Standard checks and distance.
- **Fast Pace:** Covers more ground; disadvantage on Perception.
- Travel measured in **miles per day** or **hexes**, depending on mapping mode.
- Environmental modifiers (weather, elevation, terrain) adjust rates.

## **7.2 Foraging & Survival Procedures**

- **Foraging:** Survival check vs biome DC.
- **Weather Awareness:** Insight or Nature checks to predict shifts.
- **Shelter Building:** Varies by biome; failure may impose Exhaustion.

## **7.3 Navigation Errors**

- Failed navigation checks can result in:
  - Becoming lost
  - Reduced travel distance
  - Hazard encounters
  - Delays or doubling back

## **7.4 Environmental Threats**

- **Cold:** Risk of Exhaustion, movement penalties.
- **Heat:** Water loss, fatigue checks.
- **Storms:** Disadvantage on ranged attacks, navigation, or concentration.
- **Poisonous air/spores:** Save vs poison; lingering effects.
- **Arcane anomalies:** Unpredictable spell interactions, surges.

---

# **8. HAZARD & ENVIRONMENT LIBRARY (EXPANDED)**

## **8.1 Hazard Categories**

Prime recognizes five broad hazard categories. These categories are **setting‑agnostic** and support any world’s environment:

- **Environmental:** heat, cold, storms, high altitude, deep wilderness, sea travel, caves, disease and other natural phenomena.
- **Structural:** collapsing ruins, pits and chasms, unstable bridges, sinkholes, avalanches, cave‑ins and other terrain failures.
- **Magical:** wild magic surges, dead‑magic zones, antimagic pockets, leyline fractures, planar thin spots and other arcane anomalies.
- **Social/Urban:** riots, mob hostility, political tension, crime waves, factional oppression and other hazards arising from society.
- **Travel:** exhaustion, navigation failure, foraging failure, lost gear, extreme weather exposure and other hazards intrinsic to long journeys.

## **8.2 Hazard Template (Standardized)**

- **Trigger Condition:** what sets it off.
- **Detection:** passive or active Perception/Investigation.
- **Primary Effect:** damage, Exhaustion, movement loss, conditions.
- **Secondary Effect:** spreading harm, ticking clock, transformation.
- **Countermeasures:** checks, spells, tools, clever play.
- **Escalation Clock:** 3–6 stage track where failures worsen outcome.

## **8.3 Sample Hazards**

**Frostbite Gale:** Cold damage + Exhaustion risk each hour.

**Leyline Disruption Pulse:** Arcana save vs wild magic surge.

**Creeping Verdancy Bloom:** Rapid plant growth; Restrained on failure.

**Shatter‑Stone Tremor:** Falling debris; Dex save or bludgeoning damage.

## **8.4 Hazard Intensity & DC Ladder**

Hazards are rated by **intensity**. Use these categories to select appropriate DCs and consequences:

| Intensity | Typical DC Range | Consequence Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Low** | 5–10 | Minor discomfort, small hit of damage, or a brief movement penalty. |
| **Standard** | 10–15 | Moderate damage, Exhaustion checks, one condition or resource loss. |
| **High** | 15–20 | Significant damage or multiple conditions; persistent effect until mitigated. |
| **Extreme** | 20–25+ | Severe damage or life‑threatening effect; multi‑stage escalation requiring group effort. |

Hazard DCs may be modified by environment, tools, spells, or creative problem‑solving. World‑specific documents provide additional modifiers.

## **8.5 Exploration & Travel Hazard Framework**

During overland travel, the GM determines how often hazard checks occur based on distance and environment:

- **Pace:** For each **day** of travel (or every **4 hours** on a hex‑crawl), roll for potential hazards. Dangerous regions may require checks **per hex** or **per major terrain change**.
- **Travel Checks:** Characters may need to make **Navigation (Survival)**, **Foraging (Survival)**, **Endurance (Constitution)**, or **Stealth (Dexterity)** checks. Use DCs appropriate to the hazard intensity and terrain.
- **Rest Safety Tiers:** Campsites and shelters are classified as **Safe**, **Risky**, **Hostile**, or **Extreme**.
  - **Safe:** No hazard checks; characters recover normally.
  - **Risky:** One Low or Standard hazard check during rest.
  - **Hostile:** One Standard or High hazard check; may interrupt rest.
  - **Extreme:** Multiple High or Extreme hazard checks; resting may be impossible.

Environmental descriptions and world‑specific documents (e.g., macro‑regions, biomes) inform which tiers are common and how often they occur.

## **8.6 Hazard Persistence & Recovery**

Hazards may persist across scenes or travel segments.

- **Duration:** Some hazards (storms, wild magic zones) last **hours to days** and follow an **escalation clock**. Others are resolved after a single check.
- **Mitigation:** Parties can reduce or eliminate hazards through **skill checks**, **spells**, **rituals**, **tools**, or **faction assistance**. Mitigating a hazard may decrease its intensity category or clear it entirely.
- **Recovery:** After exposure, characters may need **Long Rests**, **medical care**, or **magical healing** to remove conditions or exhaustion levels induced by hazards.

World‑specific documents describe unique hazard behaviors and additional recovery options. This system is intentionally general so campaign settings can overlay specific rules.

---

# **9. ENCOUNTER TEMPLATES (EXPANDED)**

## **9.1 Combat Encounter Archetypes**

- **Skirmish:** Few enemies; tactical movement.
- **Attrition Fight:** Multiple waves; resource drain.
- **Boss Encounter:** Single powerful foe with lair actions or phases.
- **Environmental Battle:** Terrain or hazards are primary threats.

## **9.2 Non‑Combat Encounters**

- **Social Conflict:** contested checks, attitude shifts.
- **Exploration Tests:** navigation puzzles, ancient mechanisms.
- **Survival Trials:** weather, exhaustion, foraging challenges.
- **Mystical Phenomena:** dream events, magical echoes, visions.

## **9.3 Encounter Scaling Logic**

- Evaluate **action economy**.
- Evaluate **terrain advantage**.
- Evaluate **synergy** of enemy abilities.
- Assign difficulty: Easy / Moderate / Hard / Deadly.

---

# **10. REST SYSTEMS & EXPLORATION CLOCKS**

## **10.1 Short Rests**

- Hit Dice spent for healing.
- Classes restore certain abilities.
- Environmental pressure may limit rest availability.

## **10.2 Long Rests**

- Restore most abilities.
- Remove 1 Exhaustion level.
- Require safety: interrupted rests give partial benefit.

## **10.3 Exploration Clocks**

Clocks represent accumulating tension:

- **Travel Clocks:** hazards, storms, pursuit.
- **Dungeon Clocks:** structural collapse, rising water, enemy reinforcements.
- **Social Clocks:** rumors spreading, diplomatic deadlines.

Each clock has 4–8 segments; failures or time jumps fill segments.

---

# **11. WEAPON MASTERY TABLE (SYSTEM‑READY)**

## **11.1 Weapon Group → Mastery Mapping (Example Layout)**

**Swords (Longsword, Greatsword):** Cleave, Graze, Sap.

**Axes (Battleaxe, Greataxe):** Cleave, Topple.

**Hammers (Warhammer, Maul):** Push, Slow.

**Spears & Polearms:** Push, Topple; reach properties.

**Daggers:** Nick, Sap.

Campaigns may alter mapping in Tier‑1.

## **11.2 Mastery Switching & Scaling**

- Some classes can swap mastery properties during long rests.
- Higher‑level martials gain additional mastery slots or upgraded effects.

---

# **12. CREATURES, NPCS & ENCOUNTER LOGIC (FINAL EXPANSION)**

## **12.1 Creature Template**

- **Stat block structure:** AC, HP, Speed, STR–CHA, saves, skills.
- **Actions:** melee, ranged, special abilities.
- **Reactions:** parries, counters, spell deflection.
- **Legendary Actions:** for major foes, 2–3 options.
- **Lair Actions:** environment‑driven abilities.

## **12.2 NPC Templates**

- **Compact NPCs:** simplified stat arrays; ideal for minor characters.
- **Full NPC Sheets:** resource tracking, action lists, spell loadouts.

## **12.3 Encounter Difficulty Interpretation**

Prime evaluates:

- Number of foes vs party size.
- Ability synergy (e.g., grapplers + spellcasters).
- Monster resistances or immunities.
- Terrain advantages or escape routes.

---

# **13. QUICK REFERENCE TABLES (EXPANDED)**

## **13.1 Ability Check DCs**

5 easy, 10 moderate, 15 meaningful, 20 hard, 25+ extreme.

## **13.2 Cover Table**

- Half cover: +2 AC
- Three‑quarters: +5 AC
- Total cover: cannot be targeted

## **13.3 Light & Vision**

- Bright, Dim, Darkness.
- Darkvision interacts differently in magical darkness.

## **13.4 Movement & Terrain Costs**

- Climbing/swimming: x2 unless proficient.

## **13.5 Weapon Mastery Summary**

(see mastery table above)

---

# **14. OPTIONAL PRIME-RECOMMENDED VARIANTS**
These variants are **not** defaults but are recommended toggles for tables that want slightly grittier, more cinematic, or more consistent outcomes. They are OFF unless a user or campaign explicitly enables them.

## **14.1 Perkins Critical Hit Variant**
A streamlined crit rule used at many modern 5e/2024 tables:
- On a **critical hit** (natural 20 on the attack roll):
  - **Maximize the first damage die** (weapon/base damage die only).
  - Roll all remaining damage dice as normal.
- This reduces extreme swinginess, keeps crits impactful, and aligns with the design philosophy of consistent but exciting damage spikes.

### *Example:*  
A longsword (1d8) crit deals:
- **8** (maximized base die) + **1d8** (rolled crit die) + modifiers.

---

## **14.2 Revival Exhaustion Rule (Revised: Universal Downed Exhaustion)**
Whenever a creature is **restored from 0 HP**—*regardless of whether they have made death saving throws yet*—they gain **1 level of Exhaustion**.

### Rationale:
- Being knocked unconscious is traumatic and draining.
- Prevents “yo‑yo healing” from trivializing combat danger.
- Synergizes well with the cleaner 2024 exhaustion model.

### Applies whenever:
- A creature is healed from 0 HP by spell, ability, potion, item, or class feature.
- A creature regains consciousness after being downed in any way.

### Does *not* apply when:
- A creature is reduced below max HP but **not** to 0.
- A creature is stabilized but **not healed** yet.

---

## **14.3 Major NPC & Villain Death Save Rule**
Important NPCs and villains do **not** die instantly at 0 HP unless dramatically appropriate. Instead, they follow the **same death saving throw rules as player characters**.

### Effects:
- Villains get a chance to survive a fight for interrogation, plot continuation, or rescue.
- Removes the awkwardness of “one lucky crit deletes the campaign’s primary antagonist.”
- OPS recognizes major NPCs flagged with this rule as having a **death-save state**.

### Implementation:
- Minor NPCs still die outright unless the DM opts in.
- Major NPCs use the standard PC death save sequence.

---
- A creature is reduced to 0 HP and healed *before* making any death saves.
- A creature is stabilized but not healed.

---
## **14.4 Additional Optional House Rules (Table-Enabled)**
These are **optional modules** the user or DM may toggle on. They are not defaults.

### **14.4.1 Flanking Variant**
Two creatures directly opposite a target may gain either:
- **Advantage on melee attacks**, *or*
- **+2 bonus to hit** (less swingy variant).

### **14.4.2 Failing Forward Framework**
Failed skill checks may still progress the scene with added complications. Useful for narrative-focused campaigns.

### **14.4.3 Injury / Wound Threshold System**
When a creature takes massive damage or suffers a crit, they may gain a persistent wound that imposes penalties until treated.

### **14.4.4 Enhanced Advantage / Disadvantage (3d20 Variant)**
When multiple sources stack:
- **Superior Advantage:** roll 3d20, keep highest.
- **Superior Disadvantage:** roll 3d20, keep lowest.

### **14.4.5 Stamina Burst / Sprinting Rule**
A creature may attempt a **burst of speed** by rolling Athletics or Acrobatics to temporarily gain additional movement, often with a minor drawback (fatigue, vulnerability, or tactical exposure).
