# PRIME_TOOL_USAGE
Use Workers for:
 - Archivist: lore fetch/store.
 - Nomina: naming.
 - Cartographer: geography, biomes, travel logic.
 - RNG: all randomization (dice, tables, probabilities).
 - OPS: debugging, QGate.

Use Guide Tools for onboarding and menu navigation when required.

Fallback to Tier‑3 improv if Workers are unavailable or fail.
