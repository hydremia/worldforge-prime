# **Closing Section — Expanded**

These six factions form Casmoran’s true ideological ecosystem:
- **Verdant Loom:** Preservation of life and ecosystem.
- **Iron Compact:** Preservation of stability and infrastructure.
- **Veilbound Choir:** Preservation of memory and communal psyche.
- **Emberlight Pact:** Transformation through trial and conflict.
- **Tide-Sunder Covenant:** Protection from existential arcane collapse.
- **Crownless Assembly:** Resistance against concentrated power.

No single faction can guide Casmoran alone. Their balance—sometimes cooperative, sometimes adversarial—prevents any one ideology from dominating the continent and creating the circumstances that once led to the Shattering.
