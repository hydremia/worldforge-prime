## **6.1 Mountain Orcs & Half-Orcs**
**Summary:** Mountain Orcs form oathclans shaped by freezing winds, scarce resources, and deep ancestral traditions. Their endurance and discipline make them natural ridge guardians and highhold defenders.

**Physical Traits:** Broad, dense musculature; gray or stone‑green skin; thick tusks with pronounced curvature; braided or bound hair to resist wind.

**Culture:** Frost rites, stone‑circle councils, highhold guardian lodges, and strict clan oaths. Hospitality is tightly regulated—guests are protected fiercely but expected to honor clan law.

**History:** Many clans trace ancient alliances and conflicts with giant‑kin, goliaths, and frost‑touched beastfolk.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Tide‑Sunder:** High‑altitude rift scouts.
- **Iron Compact:** Trusted for labor, defense, and hazardous mountain repairs.

**Perceptions:** Fierce but principled, honorable to a fault.

---

## **6.2 Basin Orcs & Half-Orcs**
**Summary:** Basin Orcs are integrated trade‑road settlers who balance physical labor with strong community ties. They often form mixed‑species families and play key roles in agriculture, defense, and river transport.

**Physical Traits:** Earth‑brown to green‑gray skin tones; calm but imposing builds; practical work clothing.

**Culture:** Work‑crews, communal meal halls, extended kinships, and militia service. Respect is earned through reliability rather than challenges.

**History:** Descended from Greenwood or Highland migrations seeking stable land and opportunity.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Crownless Assembly:** Strong presence in worker advocacy.
- **Iron Compact:** Frequently employed for road‑building and defensive infrastructure.

**Perceptions:** Misunderstood by outsiders but deeply respected locally.

---

## **6.3 Coast Orcs & Half-Orcs**
**Summary:** Coast Orcs form the backbone of storm‑season labor, ship‑guard crews, harbor defense forces, and rescue teams. They are shaped by relentless salt winds, rough seas, and the demands of survival.

**Physical Traits:** Broad builds; wind‑hardened skin with subtle salt abrasion patterns; hair bound against storms.

**Culture:** Tidal honor codes, crew‑family structures, storm rites, and shared feast halls for storm survivors.

**History:** Many descend from migratory orcish lines that settled in ports during Reconstruction, merging clan traditions with maritime culture.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Tide‑Sunder:** Storm‑handling, rift coastal defense.
- **Emberlight Pact:** Occasional philosophical kinship through trial traditions.

**Perceptions:** Strong, loyal, indispensable during crises.

---

## **6.4 Inner Sea Orcs & Half-Orcs**
**Summary:** Inner Sea Orcs are integrated into nearly every major city as guards, labor leaders, militia trainers, bodyguards, enforcers of guild contracts, and civic defenders.

**Physical Traits:** Sturdy builds; city‑adapted armor and clothing; tusks often capped or decorated to indicate trade or role.

**Culture:** Union halls, militia lodges, communal dormitories, structured apprenticeship networks. Clan identity becomes blended with guild affiliation.

**History:** Critical during Reconstruction for holding defensive lines against Shattering‑echo creatures and raiders.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Crownless Assembly:** Strong role in labor rights.
- **Iron Compact:** Security and logistics contractors.

**Perceptions:** Dependable, disciplined, socially central in working districts.

---

## **6.5 Highlands Orcs & Half-Orcs**
**Summary:** Highlands Orcs embrace a philosophy of trial‑through‑storm. They follow migration patterns, storm belts, and lightning‑scarred routes through the Plateau.

**Physical Traits:** Tall, dry‑muscled builds; ruddy or tawny skin; sharp storm‑calloused features.

**Culture:** Trial camps, storm vigils, horizon duels, sky‑path migrations. Honor is tied to enduring hardship rather than conquering rivals.

**History:** Trace ancestry to nomadic Orcish groups that followed megafauna and storm‑fronts long before recorded calendars.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Emberlight Pact:** Natural philosophical alignment.
- **Tide‑Sunder:** Storm‑watch support.

**Perceptions:** Fearless, disciplined, spiritually intense.

---

## **6.6 Greenwood Orcs & Half-Orcs**
**Summary:** Greenwood Orcs act as territorial guardians of sacred spaces—bloomfront patrols, grove‑wardens, and protectors of forest boundaries.

**Physical Traits:** Bark‑rough skin; root‑curving tusks; earthy and mossy coloration.

**Culture:** Ritual hunts, conflict mediation between forest creatures and outsiders, grove oath circles.

**History:** Descended from hunter lineages who once tracked megafauna through ancient forest routes.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Verdant Loom:** Direct stewardship ties.
- **Veilbound Choir:** Dream‑monitoring and ancestral rites.

**Perceptions:** Feared by poachers; respected by forestfolk.

## **6.7 Planar-Touched Overlays (Sevenfold Canon)**

The following planar-touched overlays can manifest in **Orcs & Half-Orcs** (as in any Casmoran lineage). For full mechanical details, use the standard Aasimar / Tiefling / Genasi options reskinned as below, and refer to the dedicated Planar-Touched document.

- **Twilight-Touched (Aasimar analog):** Dreamfold resonance, omen-lit presence, ancestral memory echoes.
- **Riftborne (Tiefling analog):** Shattering-scar instability, uncanny timing, probability slippage rather than fiendish blood.
- **Storm-Touched (Air Genasi analog):** Lightning and wind affinity, storm-charged aura, ease with heights and rapid movement.
- **Tideborn (Water Genasi analog):** Instinctive feel for tides, currents, and floods; sea-and-river attunement.
- **Bloom-Touched (Earth Genasi analog):** Flora-focused wild magic, growth surges, subtle plant resonance instead of bare stone.
- **Frostborne (Fire Genasi analog, cold-refit):** Cold-plane inversion of fire traits—hoarfrost aura, ice-aspected resilience and magic.
- **Leyborne (Unique Casmoran overlay):** Descendants or survivors of the OCE portal lattice collapse, marked by geometric features and spatial/structural intuition; metaphysically displaced into Casmoran rather than native-born planar ties.
