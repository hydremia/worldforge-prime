## **1.1 Mountain Humans**
**Summary:** Mountain Humans live along ridgelines, glacial valleys, and high passes where survival depends on preparation and cooperation. Their settlements often serve as waystations between dwarf holds, giant-kin territories, and lowland traders.

**Physical Traits:** Broad-shouldered builds, wind-burnished skin, thick hair; clothing of layered wool, furs, and heavy boots suited for ice and rock. Scars from frostbite, ropework, and rockfalls are common.

**Culture:** Clan-lodges bound by seasonal oaths; avalanche rites honoring those lost to the mountain; shared granary systems; pass-wardenship as a sacred duty. Guests seeking shelter in a storm are almost never refused.

**History:** Descendants of high-altitude families who endured Shattering-era ice storms, fault ruptures, and famine. Many clans record “the year the passes broke” or similar disaster marks in their oral histories.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Iron Compact:** Oversees mountain road upkeep, bridges, and tunnels.
- **Tide-Sunder:** Maintains riftwatch posts where deep fractures intersect high passes.

**Perceptions:** Seen as stoic, reliable, famously stubborn when it matters. Lowlanders often underestimate their political savvy.

## **1.2 Basin Humans**
**Summary:** Basin Humans are river-born, pragmatic, communal descendants of reclaimed imperial farmlands and Silence-era communes. They are defined by water management, mixed settlements, and a deep sense of place.

**Physical Traits:** Sun-browned or wind-tanned skin, sturdy builds, strong hands; practical layered clothing for mud, rain, and work.

**Culture:** Council-leaning villages; irrigation cooperatives; seasonal festivals tied to floods and harvests. Hospitality norms are strong—turning someone away in a bad season is considered a serious moral failing.

**History:** Many families trace their land rights (or grudges) back to OCE-era allotments, Shattering refugee camps, or Reconstruction land-grants. "Who owned which field when" is a constant undercurrent.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Iron Compact:** Respected for stabilizing levees, mills, and roads.
- **Crownless Assembly:** Influential where landlords or local rulers overreach.
- **Veilbound Choir:** Called upon in times of drought, plague, or uncanny dreams.

**Perceptions:** Grounded, territorial about their land, slow to trust outside interference.

## **1.3 Coast Humans**
**Summary:** Coast Humans grow up amid salt winds, shifting tides, and mercantile cultures shaped by ports, storms, and seasonal migrations. They are adaptable, superstitious in a practical way, and fiercely loyal to harbor-kin.

**Physical Traits:** Sun-kissed skin, salt-stiff hair, sea-weathered features. Clothing favors oilcloth, layered wraps, and stormproof boots, often decorated with charms against drowning or bad luck.

**Culture:** Harbor councils, boat-families, and trade-charters define civic organization. Tide-omens and storm calendars guide fishing, travel, and festivals. Shipwreck stories and "who braved which storm" are social currency.

**History:** Descendants of Shattering-era coastal camps, storm refugee lines, and early Reconstruction shipwright enclaves. Many families keep fragments of hull-planks or storm-bells as heirlooms.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Tide-Sunder:** Revered for containing rifts and guiding storm responses.
- **Mirethiel clergy:** Trusted for tide-blessings and safe-crossing rites.
- **Crownless Assembly:** Active in ports resisting monopolistic trade houses and predatory tariffs.

**Perceptions:** Viewed as bold, opportunistic, and lucky—or reckless and storm-drunk, depending on who you ask.

## **1.4 Inner Sea Humans**
**Summary:** Inner Sea Humans are cosmopolitan, adaptive, and deeply intertwined with centuries of trade, scholarship, conflict, and magical recovery. They are shaped by crossroads living, where cultures, factions, and ideas collide daily.

**Physical Traits:** Extremely varied; clothing blends practical travel gear with civic fashion, often marked by guild colors, city badges, or faction symbols.

**Culture:** City-state councils, trade leagues, arcane schools, communal festivals, and faction-aligned neighborhoods. Civic pride and political awareness run high; people tend to know not just their neighbors, but their neighbors’ allegiances.

**History:** Heirs to the Shattering’s epicenter, Reconstruction’s first alliances, and the continual reinvention of arcane infrastructure. Many families have stories tied to specific battles, treaties, or urban reforms.

**Faction Influence:** All major factions operate openly here, but:
- **Veilbound Choir** and **Iron Compact** are especially entrenched.
- **Crownless Assembly** and **Emberlight Pact** maintain influential cells.

**Perceptions:** Resourceful, politically savvy, occasionally overconfident and jaded.

## **1.5 Highlands Humans**
**Summary:** Highlands Humans are shaped by vast mesas, open skies, and storm-forged landscapes of the Plateau. Life here demands endurance, adaptability, and a philosophy centered on personal and communal trials.

**Physical Traits:** Sun-hardened skin, windswept hair, lean muscular frames. Clothing leans toward leathers, stormproof cloaks, layered wraps, and talismans marking completed trials.

**Culture:** Clan-roaming caravans, open-air rites, sky-fast competitions, ember trials, and tight-knit hearth-circles. Songs and tattoos often commemorate how a person met their greatest test.

**History:** Many families descend from nomadic bands that followed megafauna across the Plateau during the Silence, moving with storms and herds instead of borders.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Emberlight Pact:** Dominant philosophical resonance, framing trials as spiritual tempering.
- **Tide-Sunder:** Maintains stormwatch posts where Plateau storms intersect rift zones.

**Perceptions:** Passionate, resilient, intimidatingly direct. Known for respecting strength of conviction more than birth or title.

## **1.6 Greenwood Humans**
**Summary:** Greenwood Humans grow up beneath ancient trunks, bloom-wild groves, and druidic customs that predate their own recorded history. They are defined by coexistence with forces older and stranger than their villages.

**Physical Traits:** Earthy tones in skin and hair; green or hazel eyes are common. Clothing favors leathers, barkcloth, and plant-dyed fabrics in natural palettes.

**Culture:** Small, semi-isolated communities with strong ritual calendars. Loom circles and local wise-folk often guide major decisions. Storytelling, seasonal observances, and negotiated coexistence with the forest take priority over formal law.

**History:** Many lines descend from Silence-era refugees who sought shelter in the forests and were absorbed into Loom-guided communities. Their histories emphasize resilience, restraint, and the cost of cutting too deeply.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Verdant Loom:** Primary cultural influence, from agriculture to justice.
- **Veilbound Choir:** Present through ancestral dream traditions and memory rites.

**Perceptions:** Seen as mystical, serene, and deeply attuned to the uncanny—sometimes "too" comfortable with things others fear.

## **1.7 Planar-Touched Overlays (Sevenfold Canon)**

The following planar-touched overlays can manifest in **Humans** (as in any Casmoran lineage). For full mechanical details, use the standard Aasimar / Tiefling / Genasi options reskinned as below, and refer to the dedicated Planar-Touched document.

- **Twilight-Touched (Aasimar analog):** Dreamfold resonance, omen-lit presence, ancestral memory echoes.
- **Riftborne (Tiefling analog):** Shattering-scar instability, uncanny timing, probability slippage rather than fiendish blood.
- **Storm-Touched (Air Genasi analog):** Lightning and wind affinity, storm-charged aura, ease with heights and rapid movement.
- **Tideborn (Water Genasi analog):** Instinctive feel for tides, currents, and floods; sea-and-river attunement.
- **Bloom-Touched (Earth Genasi analog):** Flora-focused wild magic, growth surges, subtle plant resonance instead of bare stone.
- **Frostborne (Fire Genasi analog, cold-refit):** Cold-plane inversion of fire traits—hoarfrost aura, ice-aspected resilience and magic.
- **Leyborne (Unique Casmoran overlay):** Descendants or survivors of the OCE portal lattice collapse, marked by geometric features and spatial/structural intuition; metaphysically displaced into Casmoran rather than native-born planar ties.
