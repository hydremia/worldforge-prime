# Casmoran Subspecies Lineages — Planar-Touched (Sevenfold Overlays)

Planar-Touched are **not separate species**. They are overlays—heritage signatures that can manifest in **any lineage** (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Gnome, Halfling, Orc/Half-Orc, Beastfolk). These overlays emerge when mortal bloodlines intersect with planar forces, Shattering phenomena, wild magic, or (uniquely) the collapse of the OCE portal lattice.

Each entry maps cleanly to a standard 5e/5.5e mechanical ancestry (Aasimar, Tiefling, or one of the four Genasi), but with **Casmoran-first flavor and lore**.

This document contains the complete, unified list of all seven.

Order:
8.1 Twilight-Touched (Aasimar Analog)
8.2 Riftborne (Tiefling Analog)
8.3 Storm-Touched (Air Genasi Analog)
8.4 Tideborn (Water Genasi Analog)
8.5 Bloom-Touched (Earth Genasi Analog)
8.6 Frostborne (Fire Genasi Analog — Inverted Cold Variant)
8.7 Leyborne (Unique Casmoran Overlay)

## **8.1 Twilight-Touched — Aasimar Analog**
**Linked Biomes:** Greenwood, Inner Sea, ancient ruins, places saturated with memory.

**Summary:** Twilight-Touched individuals resonate with the **dreamfold**, the liminal realm where ancestral memories, omens, and emotional echoes intersect. Their presence carries a quiet gravity—subtle light, unnerving calm, or a sense of déjà vu in historical spaces.

**Signs:**
- Silver-sheened or reflective eyes.
- Shadow-soft luminance around hair or hands.
- Symbolic dreams that sometimes bleed into waking life.
- Intuitive sense for sacred or historical places.

**Cultural Notes:** Choir scholars consider them ideal dream-navigators. Rural communities may view them as blessed, unsettling, or both.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Veilbound Choir**: Highly valued for dreamway mapping.
- **Verdant Loom**: Occasionally sought to interpret historical grove-memory.

**Mechanical Notes:** Use **Aasimar** chassis; reflavor celestial features as dreamfold manifestations.

## **8.2 Riftborne — Tiefling Analog**
**Linked Biomes:** Inner Sea, Mountain faultlines, stabilized Shattering scars.

**Summary:** Born near a Shattering scar or during a reality-echo event, Riftborne individuals exist slightly **out of phase** with local time or probability. Their behavior and instincts can feel unnervingly prescient or discordant.

**Signs:**
- Brief shimmer or distortion at the edge of vision.
- Impeccable timing—arriving “just before” or “just after” key moments.
- Spells, abilities, or emotions syncing with environmental pulses.
- Occasional flickers of alternate possibilities.

**Cultural Notes:** Feared in superstitious regions; prized by factions that deal with anomalies.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Veilbound Choir**: Studies temporal memory echoes.
- **Tide-Sunder**: Monitors Riftborne for long-term stability markers.

**Mechanical Notes:** Use **Tiefling** chassis; reflavor fiendish elements as probability/temporal anomalies.

---

## **8.3 Storm-Touched — Air Genasi Analog**
**Linked Biomes:** Highlands, Coast, Inner Sea storm belts.

**Summary:** Storm-Touched individuals are born during elemental anomalies—lightning that bends unnaturally, winds that carry voices, pressure drops that defy physics. They are kinetic, restless, and charged with sky-energy.

**Signs:**
- Hair that shifts with static or lifts in high emotion.
- Reflective irises during storms.
- Subtle ozone scent.
- Innate ease with high winds, heights, and rapid motion.

**Cultural Notes:** Seen as storm-heralds or trial-walkers.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Emberlight Pact**: Ideal candidates for trial rites.
- **Tide-Sunder**: Stationed at storm-rift watchposts.

**Mechanical Notes:** Use **Air Genasi** chassis; reflavor lightning/air traits with storm resonance.

---

## **8.4 Tideborn — Water Genasi Analog**
**Linked Biomes:** Coast, Basin, Inner Sea.

**Summary:** Tideborn carry echoes of **planar tides**—the subtle gravitational and emotional pull of water across worlds. They read currents, storms, and floods with uncanny instinct.

**Signs:**
- Blue-green highlights in hair or skin.
- Eyes that reflect ambient light like shallow water.
- Faint scent of brine or clean river.
- Emotional states often synchronized with weather patterns.

**Cultural Notes:** Tideborn are often seen as omens—good or ill.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Tide-Sunder**: Coastal rift monitoring.
- **Mirethiel Clergy**: Tide rites, flood relief, water-blessing traditions.

**Mechanical Notes:** Use **Water Genasi** chassis.

---

## **8.5 Bloom-Touched — Earth Genasi Analog**
**Linked Biomes:** Greenwood, Basin, Inner Sea gardens.

**Summary:** Bloom-Touched are influenced by **flora-aspected wild magic**—bloomfields, enchanted seed-wards, or druidic rituals. Their lives intertwine with growth, emotion, and cycles.

**Signs:**
- Petal-patterned birthmarks.
- Subtle scent of leaves, pollen, or fresh soil.
- Harmless wild-magic flares triggered by strong emotion.
- Plants subtly lean toward them.

**Cultural Notes:** Loom circles watch them with equal parts reverence and caution.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Verdant Loom**: Primary oversight.
- **Veilbound Choir**: Tracks dream-flora resonance.

**Mechanical Notes:** Use **Earth Genasi** chassis; reflavor stone/earth abilities as flora-based.

---

## **8.6 Frostborne — Fire Genasi Analog (Cold-Reflavored)**
**Linked Biomes:** Northern tundra, glacial ranges, mountain altitudes.

**Summary:** Frostborne channel the power of the **cold plane**, an inverted analog to the fire-aligned elemental realms. Born during glacial anomalies or winter-spirit convergence, they embody endurance, clarity, and entropy-touched magic.

**Signs:**
- Pale or ice-blue skin tones.
- Cold breath in mild weather.
- Hoarfrost on eyebrows or hair during emotion spikes.
- Aura that chills the air subtly.

**Cultural Notes:** Often woven into northern myths or giant-kin sagas.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Tide-Sunder**: Investigates deep-freeze rifts.
- **Veilbound Choir**: Tracks winter-memory patterns.

**Mechanical Notes:** Use **Fire Genasi** chassis, but swap all heat/fire features for cold/ice equivalents.

---

## **8.7 Leyborne — Unique Casmoran Overlay**
**Linked Biomes:** Inner Sea, Mountains, anywhere containing ruined OCE infrastructure.

**Summary:** Leyborne are the **wildcards of Casmoran’s history**—individuals who arrived (or whose ancestors arrived) during the catastrophic collapse of the OCE portal lattice. When the network failed, countless beings were displaced:
- torn from transit mid-journey,
- scattered across worlds,
- or forcibly anchored in Casmoran as portals imploded.

Their bodies bear subtle, rhythmic echoes of the lattice itself.

**Signs:**
- Geometric or circuit-like facial symmetry.
- Rhythmic speech patterns.
- Intuitive understanding of spatial flow or structural stress.
- Disorientation when near unstable magic.

**Cultural Notes:** Leyborne ancestry is often kept private; stories vary between “blessed by the old gateways” and “marked by catastrophe.”

**Faction Influence:**
- **Iron Compact**: Values their spatial intuition.
- **Veilbound Choir**: Studies their memories of collapse-era transit.

**Mechanical Notes:** Leyborne can choose any Genasi variant mechanically, or a lightly modified Aasimar/Tiefling chassis depending on the nature of the displacement.
