## **2.1 Mountain Elves**
**Summary:** Mountain Elves dwell in alpine forests, cliffside aeries, and frost-glade sanctuaries. They value silence, perspective, and the clarity granted by thin air. Their societies emphasize contemplation and watchfulness, often seen as eerie by outsiders.

**Physical Traits:** Pale or frost-toned skin; silver-white, charcoal-gray, or ice-blue hair; elongated, wind-chiseled features. Eyes often reflect starlight or glacial blue.

**Culture:** Wind-song rites, glacier augury, sky-grove councils held during solstices. Their temples and communal halls are carved directly into cliff faces where the wind "speaks" through stone hollows.

**History:** Many descend from ancient sky-grove orders that retreated upward generations ago, abandoning lowland politics for spiritual isolation.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Veilbound Choir:** Consulted for sky omens and ancestral dreamwork.
- **Tide-Sunder:** Value them for rift vigilance along sheer cliffs.

**Perceptions:** Ethereal, remote, unsettlingly observant.

## **2.2 Basin Elves**
**Summary:** Basin Elves live along the transition between farmlands and forests, serving as boundary-keepers, horticultural experts, and long-memory stewards of land use.

**Physical Traits:** Bark-brown or river-dark skin tones; practical fabrics in muted palettes.

**Culture:** Grove-villages arranged around orchards or mixed fields. They often act as mediators between human farmers and Greenwood influences.

**History:** Longstanding role as diplomats between forest and farmland communities. Their settlements often sit atop ancient waypoints or old ritual sites.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Verdant Loom:** Cooperative ecological oversight.
- **Veilbound Choir:** Ancestral dream lineage and memory rites.
- **Iron Compact:** Occasional collaboration on waterworks and erosion control.

**Perceptions:** Patient, cautious, deliberate in speech.

## **2.3 Coast Elves**
**Summary:** Coast Elves are navigators, star-readers, and keepers of tide-myth. They treat the sea as both archive and oracle.

**Physical Traits:** Sea-glass eyes; wind-swept hair in blue, silver, or sand-gold tones. Subtle bioluminescent flecks along the cheeks or collarbone are not uncommon.

**Culture:** Cliffside aeries, lighthouse communes, tide-song traditions, and nomadic ship-fleets. Their songs serve as mnemonic tide charts.

**History:** Descendants of ancient starfarers who retreated to coastal aeries after the Elder Realms withdrew.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Tide-Sunder:** Storm prediction and sea-rift mapping.
- **Veilbound Choir:** Tide-dream and star-dream interpretations.

**Perceptions:** Enigmatic, respected, but aloof.

---

## **2.4 Inner Sea Elves**
**Summary:** Inner Sea Elves are scholars, diplomats, and mediators who thrive in multi-cultural cities. They balance ancestral wisdom with civic pragmatism.

**Physical Traits:** Subtle arcane glimmer in the eyes; hair in jewel or metallic tones; graceful posture.

**Culture:** Academy circles, trade-mediation councils, leyline conservatories, diplomatic houses. Their institutions emphasize memory-keeping and structural clarity.

**History:** Among the earliest groups to help stabilize arcane zones after the Shattering and to record early Reconstruction treaties.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Veilbound Choir:** Central to dream-cartography.
- **Iron Compact:** Trusted as arcane auditors and planners.

**Perceptions:** Cultured, calm, occasionally condescending.

---

## **2.5 Highlands Elves**
**Summary:** Highlands Elves are wanderers of wind-carved mesas, living lives defined by movement, memory, and sky.

**Physical Traits:** Bronze, sand, or sun-gold skin tones; hair streaked with copper, wind-silver, or storm-gray.

**Culture:** Traveling sky-circles, nomadic memory caravans, storm festivals, and wind-harp traditions. Their caravans leave ephemeral markers that only other elves can interpret.

**History:** Many are descendants of pre-OCE ranger orders that roamed the Plateau and observed storm patterns.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Emberlight Pact:** Shared trial philosophy.
- **Veilbound Choir:** Memory-path custodians.

**Perceptions:** Free-spirited, fiercely independent, spiritually restless.

---

## **2.6 Greenwood Elves**
**Summary:** Greenwood Elves represent some of the oldest known elven lineages in Casmoran, deeply tied to bloom cycles, ancient groves, and symbiotic forest traditions.

**Physical Traits:** Leaf-gold, moss-green, silver-dew aesthetics; clothing of woven bark, silkleaf, or druidic ritual garb.

**Culture:** Settlements harmonized with the forest; ecological consensus politics; ritual observances that reinforce both memory and ecological stewardship.

**History:** They endured the Shattering by relying on deep forest magic, which shelters and sometimes isolates them.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Verdant Loom:** Central role in guiding regional ecological balance.
- **Veilbound Choir:** Dreamfold resonance and memory rites.

**Perceptions:** Revered and sometimes resented for their aloofness.

## **2.7 Planar-Touched Overlays (Sevenfold Canon)**

The following planar-touched overlays can manifest in **Elves** (as in any Casmoran lineage). For full mechanical details, use the standard Aasimar / Tiefling / Genasi options reskinned as below, and refer to the dedicated Planar-Touched document.

- **Twilight-Touched (Aasimar analog):** Dreamfold resonance, omen-lit presence, ancestral memory echoes.
- **Riftborne (Tiefling analog):** Shattering-scar instability, uncanny timing, probability slippage rather than fiendish blood.
- **Storm-Touched (Air Genasi analog):** Lightning and wind affinity, storm-charged aura, ease with heights and rapid movement.
- **Tideborn (Water Genasi analog):** Instinctive feel for tides, currents, and floods; sea-and-river attunement.
- **Bloom-Touched (Earth Genasi analog):** Flora-focused wild magic, growth surges, subtle plant resonance instead of bare stone.
- **Frostborne (Fire Genasi analog, cold-refit):** Cold-plane inversion of fire traits—hoarfrost aura, ice-aspected resilience and magic.
- **Leyborne (Unique Casmoran overlay):** Descendants or survivors of the OCE portal lattice collapse, marked by geometric features and spatial/structural intuition; metaphysically displaced into Casmoran rather than native-born planar ties.
