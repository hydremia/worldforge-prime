## **3.1 Mountain Dwarves**
**Summary:** Mountain Dwarves are the archetypal stonefolk of Casmoran—masters of deep delves, volcanic forges, and rune-bound craft traditions. Their holdfasts form the backbone of mountain trade, law, and defense.

**Physical Traits:** Stone-gray, basalt-black, or iron-red complexions; emberlit or gem-like eyes; thick braids often adorned with metal rings or clan markers.

**Culture:** Oathclans, forge-festivals, delve expeditions, and stone-highways governance. Their fortresses embody layered defenses and engineering marvels.

**History:** Descendants of ancient hold lines tied to Vharûn’s craft myths. Many holds still maintain cracked forges or collapsed deepways from the Shattering.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Iron Compact:** Deep alliance through infrastructure and engineering doctrine.
- **Tide-Sunder:** Collaboration on fault stabilization and deep-rift mapping.

**Perceptions:** Unyielding, honorable, focused to the point of intensity.

## **3.2 Basin Dwarves**
**Summary:** Basin Dwarves adapted their stonecraft to riverlands, bridging the gap between mountain precision and lowland necessity.

**Physical Traits:** Clay-brown, river-rock, or sandstone hues; utilitarian braids; sturdy work-wear.

**Culture:** Bridgewright guilds, watermill tenders, lockwrights, and mixed settlement councils. Their approach to governance is practical—"whatever keeps the river moving."

**History:** Migrated from mountain holds during the Silence, bringing stone skills to struggling lowland communities.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Iron Compact:** Key partners in road and bridge upkeep.
- **Crownless Assembly:** Some dwarf guilds side with workers against exploitative landlords.

**Perceptions:** Reliable, stubborn negotiators, indispensable during floods.

---

## **3.3 Coast Dwarves**
**Summary:** Coast Dwarves merge stonecraft with maritime survival. They build wavebreakers, harbors, and lighthouse-forges capable of resisting the worst storms.

**Physical Traits:** Salt-bleached beards; broad, weather-hardened builds; deep-set eyes adapted to glare.

**Culture:** Sea walls, harbor councils, stonecut shipyards, storm-signal traditions.

**History:** Formed coastal redoubts during the Silence to protect vital sea lanes.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Iron Compact:** Infrastructure coordination.
- **Tide-Sunder:** Joint storm-barrier and rift-shore defense.

**Perceptions:** Dependable, blunt, "a storm doesn't negotiate."

---

## **3.4 Inner Sea Dwarves**
**Summary:** Inner Sea Dwarves are urban stonewrights, civic architects, and guild veterans who anchor the infrastructure of major cities.

**Physical Traits:** Polished beards, clean-cut hair, stone-toned palettes; minimal but precise ornamentation.

**Culture:** Engineering councils, civic guild charters, rune-stamped building codes, and public work crews.

**History:** Carried out massive Reconstruction efforts, rebuilding bridges, reservoirs, channels, and city walls.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Iron Compact:** Primary affiliation.
- **Crownless Assembly:** Appears in guild politics when workers push back against abuses.

**Perceptions:** Reliable, bureaucratic, essential.

---

## **3.5 Highlands Dwarves**
**Summary:** Highlands Dwarves are breakaway clans who left the holds to embrace open sky, storm-forged craft, and nomadic innovation.

**Physical Traits:** Bronze or burnt-umber complexions; braided beards decorated with feathers, storm-metal rings, or wind-carved beads.

**Culture:** Surface forges, mobile workshops, storm-metal crafting, clan caravans.

**History:** Sundered from traditional mountain society to pursue new ores, freer governance, and open-air life.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Emberlight Pact:** Shared trial ethos.
- **Crownless Assembly:** Caravan solidarity.

**Perceptions:** Unorthodox by mountain standards; admired for agility and creativity.

---

## **3.6 Greenwood Dwarves**
**Summary:** Greenwood Dwarves abandon vertical delving for horizontal rootwork, fungal cultivation, and ridge-warrens built into living terrain.

**Physical Traits:** Moss-toned beards; loam-brown or stone-green skin; bark-textured clothing.

**Culture:** Subterranean root-tunnels, fungal gardens, symbiotic stone-root structures.

**History:** Long-established communes who separated from holdfast life generations ago.

**Faction Influence:**
- **Verdant Loom:** Through ecological engineering.
- **Veilbound Choir:** Dream-path resonance in deep root networks.

**Perceptions:** Strange to traditional dwarves, valued by forestfolk.

## **3.7 Planar-Touched Overlays (Sevenfold Canon)**

The following planar-touched overlays can manifest in **Dwarves** (as in any Casmoran lineage). For full mechanical details, use the standard Aasimar / Tiefling / Genasi options reskinned as below, and refer to the dedicated Planar-Touched document.

- **Twilight-Touched (Aasimar analog):** Dreamfold resonance, omen-lit presence, ancestral memory echoes.
- **Riftborne (Tiefling analog):** Shattering-scar instability, uncanny timing, probability slippage rather than fiendish blood.
- **Storm-Touched (Air Genasi analog):** Lightning and wind affinity, storm-charged aura, ease with heights and rapid movement.
- **Tideborn (Water Genasi analog):** Instinctive feel for tides, currents, and floods; sea-and-river attunement.
- **Bloom-Touched (Earth Genasi analog):** Flora-focused wild magic, growth surges, subtle plant resonance instead of bare stone.
- **Frostborne (Fire Genasi analog, cold-refit):** Cold-plane inversion of fire traits—hoarfrost aura, ice-aspected resilience and magic.
- **Leyborne (Unique Casmoran overlay):** Descendants or survivors of the OCE portal lattice collapse, marked by geometric features and spatial/structural intuition; metaphysically displaced into Casmoran rather than native-born planar ties.
