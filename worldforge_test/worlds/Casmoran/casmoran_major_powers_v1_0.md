# Major Nations of Casmoran (Tier-2 Polity Anchor Profiles)
### *Nine continent-spanning anchor civilizations — one for each macro-region*

This document establishes the **Major Nation-Tier Entities** that define geopolitical power across Casmoran. Each is designed as a *regional anchor* whose influence extends *beyond* its home macro-region, shaping trade, religion, warfare, diplomacy, and post-Shattering reconstruction.

Secondary polities and city-states operate largely within their own regions. **These anchors, however, matter everywhere.**

Each major power entry includes:
- **Name (finalized)**
- **Polity Type** (kingdom, confederation, republic, dominion, etc.)
- **Capital** (or ruling seat)
- **Species Composition**
- **Pantheon Alignments** (2–3 dominant gods)
- **Government & Institutions**
- **Territory & Regional Reach**
- **Economy & Trade Importance**
- **Shattering Legacy**
- **Modern Ambitions & Problems**

Once all entries are complete, this document functions as the core political spine of Casmoran.

# 9. Inner Sea / Heartland Basin — **The Fractured Crown**

## **Polity Type**
Successor-State Constellation (a fractured web of rival principalities, arcane enclaves, ruin-island city-states, and dynastic claimants)

## **Capital / Seat of Rule**
**None.** No single faction controls enough territory, legitimacy, or arcane stability to declare a true capital. Instead, the region is a mosaic of:
- **Half-sunken OCE metropoles** whose highest tiers now form island fortresses.
- **Coastal claim-capitals** rebuilt atop reformed shorelines.
- **Ruin-islands** orbiting unstable ley pylons.
- **Floating districts** bound by planar anchors or residual arcano-tech.

## **Geographic Placement & Reach**
**Core Location:** The entire Inner Sea — a vast, irregular inland sea formed by the collapse of the Old Casmoran Empire’s heartland during the Shattering.

**Territorial Reach:**
- Each claimant controls only fragments of coastline, ruin-islands, or arcane pylons.
- Influence radiates unevenly into the **Lakelands (north)**, **Peninsulas (east)**, **Greenwood (south)**, and **Selryan Basin (southwest)**.
- Much of the sea remains **unclaimed, unstable, or lethal**.

**On map:** The Fractured Crown occupies **the entire Inner Sea and its shattered surrounding coast**.

## **Species Composition**
The most cosmopolitan and intermixed region of Casmoran, inheriting the diversity of the fallen OCE.
- Humans (multiple ancestries, including planar-touched)
- Elves (tidebound, high-arcane, dusk enclaves)
- Dwarves (deep-engineer remnants)
- Gnomes (ley-tech descendants)
- Dragonborn (descendants of imperial treaties)
- Sea elves, merfolk, triton (dominant in drowned zones)
- Beastfolk (marsh, river, avian, and deepwater lineages)
- Tieflings, aasimar, genasi (common in arcane-scarred districts)

## **Pantheon Alignments**
Almost every deity has a presence here, but three dominate the region’s power struggles:
- **Emberith** — ambition, upheaval, struggle for dominance
- **Omyr** — revelation, truth emerging from ruin, hidden knowledge
- **Zephrix** — instability, planar flux, unpredictable tides

Secondary influences:
- **Mirethiel** — tidal rhythms, reclamation
- **Lorynthos** — attempts at restoring order
- **Umbrayel** — death rites, dream-echo mediation

## **Government & Institutions**
There is no unified state, but **five major successor-states** act as the region’s predominant powers:

### **1. The Tidewall Compact**
A naval coalition controlling the largest intact OCE harbor on the northern Inner Sea.

### **2. The Azure Regent’s Claim**
A dynastic claimant ruling from a cliff-city built atop the remains of a collapsed skyspire.

### **3. The Nine-Point Archonate**
A mage-dominant enclave occupying a ruin-island formed around shattered ley pylons.

### **4. The Crownward Tribunal**
A bureaucracy-heavy remnant faction attempting to restore OCE law.

### **5. The Crimson Bank**
A consortium of merchant princes owning and operating entire coastal districts.

Additional notable forces:
- pirate flotillas
- arcane salvage guilds
- ruin-squatters
- fey-tide courts
- kelp-forest tribes
- Umbrayelic death-orders

## **Economy & Trade**
- Salvage-driven economy: OCE artifacts, machinery fragments, spelltech remnants
- Coastal trade: lumber, metals, refined reagents, exotic coral goods
- Smuggling and illicit markets thrive
- Ley-tech extraction and research dominates wealthy enclaves
- Ruin exploration is both the region’s greatest wealth and greatest danger

## **Shattering Legacy**
This region bears the **deepest wound** of the Shattering:
- entire cities sank beneath the sea
- leyline pylons detonated and inverted
- skybridges collapsed
- planar gates ruptured

Modern anomalies include:
- **wild tides** infused with unstable arcane charge
- **ghost currents** that echo past events
- **temporal eddies** from Omyr-influenced truth-sites
- **anti-magic gutters** from Yhesseth’s scars
- **planar fogstorms** linked to Zephrix

## **Modern Ambitions & Problems**
- No claimant can unify the region, creating unstable power cycles.
- The Nine-Point Archonate is close to reactivating a pylon — dangerously.
- The Azure Regent forms alliances through diplomacy and sorcery.
- The Tidewall Compact battles piracy and arcane storms.
- The Tribunal’s laws are ignored outside a few coastal enclaves.
- Selrya and the Peninsulas both covet stable sea routes.

**Overarching Threat:** Many scholars fear the **Crownfall Basin** still houses a dormant OCE world-engine — a device capable of restoring or annihilating Casmoran.

**Role:** The Fractured Crown is the volatile, ruin-rich heart of Casmoran — a geopolitical fault line whose unraveling or unification will determine the continent’s fate.
