# Aerathwyn, the Verdant Mother (Tier-2 Deity Profile)

## I. Core Identity
*(Full expansion will begin upon your approval.)*

**Aerathwyn, the Verdant Mother** is the primordial force of forests, growth, beasts, natural cycles, and the unyielding will of the wild. She is nature unbound—lush, nurturing, and fierce in equal measure. Her presence saturates the Greenwood Arc, the Lakelands, deep untouched forests, and the borderlands where nature reclaims what the Shattering destroyed. Aerathwyn predates mortal civilization and embodies the ancient truth that life persists not through gentleness but through adaptation and unbroken cycles.

She is not a pastoral goddess; she is the relentless will of nature to persist.
