# Vharûn, the Mountain-Heart (Tier-2 Deity Profile)

## I. Core Identity

**Vharûn, the Mountain-Heart** is the primordial embodiment of stone, endurance, lineage, pressure, and forging fire. They are not simply a god *of* mountains—they **are** the mountains: the ancient tectonic pulse beneath Casmoran, the memory of stone, the quiet strength that withstands ages. Vharûn is steady, immovable, and impossibly ancient, predating written lore and even the earliest Elder Realms. Their presence is felt in deep caverns, iron veins, volcanic hearts, dwarven halls, and the steady drum of a hammer striking steel. Their worship centers on resilience, mastery of craft, and the honoring of ancestors whose labor shaped the world.

## II. Domains, Aspects, and Divine Nature

**Primary Domains:** Earth, Stone, Forge, Endurance, Ancestry, Oaths, Craftsmanship.
**Secondary Aspects:** Pressure, Volcanoes, Ruin-Stability, Deep Time, Buried Secrets.

Vharûn is a deity of **accumulated strength** rather than sudden force. Their power expresses through:
- the slow tectonic shift of mountains,
- the constant compression that creates gems and metals,
- the flames that temper steel,
- the lineage of families and clans,
- the endurance to withstand collapse.

Though often depicted as stern and unyielding, Vharûn is not cruel—they value resilience over brutality, stability over destruction. Their “voice” is the rumble of earth, the grind of stone, the crack of cooling metal.

### **The Ember-Kin**
A radical offshoot claiming Vharûn teaches not endurance but domination of the weak, often exiled by mainstream clergy.
