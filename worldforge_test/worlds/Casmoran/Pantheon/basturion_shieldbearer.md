# Basturion, the Shieldbearer (Tier-2 Deity Profile)

## I. Core Identity
*(Full expansion will begin once you confirm.)*

**Basturion, the Shieldbearer** is the Concordant God of protection, unity, law, guardianship, fortitude, and the noble duty of standing between danger and the vulnerable. Emerging during the Old Casmoran Empire when native guardian-spirits fused with human martial gods, Basturion represents *order with purpose*—defense without tyranny, strength without cruelty, and authority earned through service.

His presence is felt in city walls, vigilant sentries, oaths sworn upon steel, communal assemblies, and the bond between shieldmates. Basturion teaches that safety is sacred, community is worth defending, and an oath is a fortress of the spirit.
