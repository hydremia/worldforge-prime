# Umbrayel, the Night Shepherd (Tier-2 Deity Profile)

## I. Core Identity

**Umbrayel, the Night Shepherd** is the Elder Power of moonlight, dreams, rest, memory, and the gentle transition of souls from one cycle to the next. They are neither a god of death nor a judge of the dead—Umbrayel is the *guide*, the lantern-bearer who ensures no soul is lost in darkness. Their presence is the cool calm of night after hardship, the dream that brings clarity, the hush over a community in mourning, the soft footsteps escorting a soul to its next horizon.

Umbrayel is deeply trusted across Casmoran by mourners, dream-readers, shepherds, travelers, scholars of memory, spirit-tenders, and those who fear oblivion. To invoke Umbrayel is to seek peace, guidance, solace, and safe passage—whether across land, between states of mind, or through the veil of death.
