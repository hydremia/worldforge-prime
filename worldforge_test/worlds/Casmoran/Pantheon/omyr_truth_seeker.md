# Omyr, the Truth-Seeker (Tier-2 Deity Profile)

## I. Core Identity

**Omyr, the Truth-Seeker**, is the Outer Walker of revelation, piercing insight, exposed secrets, uncomfortable clarity, and the collapse of illusion. Where Lorynthos preserves truth in the form of recorded knowledge, Omyr delivers truth *raw*—unfiltered, immediate, often transformative or devastating.

Omyr is the god of:
- the moment you realize you've been lied to,
- the epiphany that changes your life,
- the confession that finally frees you,
- the vision that pierces all deception,
- the truth you never wanted but can no longer deny.

His presence is cold, bright, and absolute. He offers sight, not comfort; revelation, not reassurance. Many fear him, yet none can deny that his touch—though painful—brings necessary clarity.

## II. Domains, Aspects, and Divine Nature

**Primary Domains:** Revelation, Insight, Secrets, Illusions, Clarity, True Sight.  
**Secondary Aspects:** Honesty, Exposure, Vision, Perception, Consequence.

Omyr’s nature is direct, unsparing, and surgical. His divine power manifests as:
- illusions breaking apart like glass,
- hidden motives surfacing involuntarily,
- visions that reveal buried memories or concealed truths,
- revelations that reorder entire communities,
- the stripping away of comforting delusions.

He is not cruel—merely indifferent to whether truth brings joy or ruin.
