# **Casmoran Biomes — Environmental Macro-Zones (v1.0)**

This document defines the six primary **biomes** of Casmoran. Biomes are **environmental macro-zones** that transcend political borders and shape culture, ancestry, lineage variants, and regional identity. They are *not* macro-regions or nations — they are landscape archetypes that impact every species and faction.

## **1. Greenwood**
**Temperate ancient forests • High humidity • Dense canopy • Wild-magic saturation**

The Greenwood biome includes the continent's vast forest arcs, old-growth woods, bloom-prone wildlands, and druidic heartlands. These areas often host Verdant Loom enclaves, fae-touched groves, and dream-thick ecosystems. Life here is layered, cyclical, and resilient.

## **2. Basin**
**Fertile lowlands • River networks • Reclaimed farmland • Transitional frontier**

The Basin biome covers wide floodplains, agricultural lowlands, river deltas, and trade-corridor settlements. Historically shaped by OCE agriculture and post-Shattering reclamation, Basin lands blend civilization with frontier risk. Choir, Compact, and Assembly influences often intersect here.

## **3. Coast**
**Maritime climate • Saltwinds • Tidal cultures • Storm exposure**

Coast biomes represent shorelines, peninsulas, littoral trade cities, fishing clans, and island chains. Seas, storms, and tides define life here. Mirethiel, Thalvyr, and Tessimir influence local traditions. Coastal societies tend toward adaptability and negotiation with the sea.

## **4. Highlands**
**Plateaus • Mesas • High plains • Storm-swept elevations**

The Highlands biome includes plateau cultures, steppe nomads, mesa settlements, and exposed highlands shaped by elemental winds. Emberlight philosophies, nomadic trials, and storm-forged traditions define these regions. Sparse vegetation but rich cultural diversity.

## **5. Mountains**
**Ridges • Forges • Caverns • Glacial heights**

Mountain biomes encompass Dawnwall, Redspine, and Highmark Hold regions — mineral-rich ridgelines, deep caverns, volcanic seams, and massive tectonic formations. Dwarven, giant-kin, and forge cultures dominate here. Vharûn's influence is strong in myth and craft.

---

## **6. Inner Sea**
**Cultural crossroads • Arcane residues • Mixed terrain • Historical epicenters**

The Inner Sea biome surrounds the Shattering cradle — a mixture of reclaimed ruins, diverse city-states, fertile valleys, arcane anomalies, and major trade arteries. Almost every faction is present here. This biome functions as Casmoran’s cosmopolitan anchor.
