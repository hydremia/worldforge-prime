# History of Casmoran (Tier-1 Canon)

## I. The Primordial Age (≥ 12,000 years ago)
**The Age Before Memory**
- Era predating written history, magic theory, and cultural lineage.
- Dominated by primordial beings, elemental forces, and proto-spirits.
- Early ancestors of dwarves, elves, orcs, beastfolk, and giant-kin emerge.
- Ruins from this time are extremely rare and incomprehensible.

---

## II. The Age of First Realms (~10,000 → 4,000 years ago)
**The Elder Age**
- Native species rise across Casmoran, forming the continent’s earliest civilizations.
- Magic develops naturally via leylines, elemental currents, lunar power, and ancestral rites.
- Elves establish woodland realms; dwarves build citadels in the Redspine and Dawnwall roots.
- Orcs dominate steppe and highland cultures; halflings shape river-valley communities.
- Beastfolk and fae powers influence remote areas.
- Proto-subspecies evolve regionally over millennia.
- No planar magic yet; civilizations remain culturally isolated.

## III. The Imperial Age (~4,000 → ~1,200 years ago)
**The Age of Gates**

### A. Arrival of Humans (~4,000 years ago)
- Humans enter Casmoran through early planar experiments by native mages.
- Bring divine magic, planar theory, foreign gods, metallurgy, and rapid cultural expansion.
- Become catalysts for continental transformation, not conquerors.

### B. Rise of the Old Casmoran Empire (OCE) (~3,200 → 2,200 years ago)
- Humans and native peoples combine knowledge to build the OCE.
- Civilization masters planar gatecraft, astral conduits, and leyline-binding.
- Establish planar treaties (the Concord) and build vast infrastructure.
- Arcane academies develop as powerful institutions.

### C. The Shattering Era (~2,200 → ~1,200 years ago)
- A millennium of decline marked by planar instability and magical failures.
- Theories include leyline inversion, planar gate collapse, divine conflict, astral recession, and political fragmentation.
- Final cataclysm (~1,200 years ago) creates the Inner Sea and destroys the OCE.

---

## IV. The Age of Silence (~1,200 → ~900 years ago)
**Three centuries of magical collapse**
- Arcane, divine, and planar magic fail across Casmoran.
- Leylines go inert; waygates collapse; enchanted items malfunction or explode.
- Magical creatures vanish, mutate, or hibernate.
- Populations crash as civilizations scramble for survival.

### Technological Adaptation
- With magic gone, societies innovate rapidly.
- Development of mechanical engineering, pressure systems, gearworks, metallurgy, and alchemical chemistry.
- Proto-artificer traditions form as people salvage and reinterpret pre-Shattering technology.

---

## V. The Reawakening (~900 → ~600 years ago)
Magic slowly returns.

### Phase 1 — Flicker Magic (~900–750)
- Druids sense the land stirring.
- Wild magic surges; first post-Silence sorcerers appear.
- Magic items react unpredictably.

### Phase 2 — Leyline Murmurs (~750–600)
- Leylines begin to hum faintly.
- Low-tier spells stabilize; divine connections reform.
- Wizards and artificers reestablish arcane study.

---

## VI. The Re-Emergence (~600 → ~400 years ago)
Magic returns at scale.
- Arcane academies, temples, guilds, and magical traditions are rebuilt.
- Artificers blend returning arcana with prototech innovations.
- Societies stabilize, though fear of another collapse lingers.

---

## VII. The Modern Era (~400 years ago → present)
**The Age of Re-Emergence**
- Multi-species societies flourish; cultural and biological diversity is high.
- Borders remain fluid; influence zones dominate over fixed nations.
- Frontier regions and ruin zones remain vast and dangerous.
- Magic and low-tech coexist; trust in magic varies by region.
- Multiple layers of ruins exist: Elder Age, OCE, post-Silence prototech.
- The Shattering remains unsolved, with conflicting myths and partial truths.

Casmoran is a world rebuilding—powerful, diverse, wounded, and full of rediscovery.
