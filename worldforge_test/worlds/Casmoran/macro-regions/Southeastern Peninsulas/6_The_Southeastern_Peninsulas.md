A warm, humid expanse of river deltas, archipelagos, mangrove coasts, and deep natural harbors. The Peninsulas formed the maritime backbone of the OCE and still contain half-sunken sea-fortresses, drowned port districts, and storm-wrecked ley pylons. Merchant republics, ship-clans, sea elves, and mixed-species coastal enclaves dominate the present era.

Mirethiel and Tessimir shape daily life—tidal rituals, wind-trade cycles, and seasonal commerce define the region. Lorynthos’ guild archives preserve vast naval records, while Umbrayel’s lantern-priests guide sailors through dream-omens and night navigation. Sea storms borne of Thalvyr’s tempests occasionally merge with Zephrix’s planar tears, spawning dangerous maritime anomalies.

The Peninsulas are one of Casmoran’s most culturally diverse regions, serving as the continent’s gateway to foreign lands and arriving peoples.
