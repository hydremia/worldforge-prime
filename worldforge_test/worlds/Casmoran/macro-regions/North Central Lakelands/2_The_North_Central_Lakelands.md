A fertile spread of rolling highlands, massive lake clusters, and river systems that drain toward every edge of the continent. The Lakelands have been continuously inhabited for millennia, making them a tapestry of **layered civilizations**—native polities, early planar-blooded enclaves, OCE provincial capitals, and patchwork successor states. Cities are diverse, multi-species, magically active, and culturally influential.

The region is deeply shaped by **Mirethiel’s flow**, visible in sacred river confluences, canal-temples, and lake rituals that survived even the Silence. Lorynthos’ influence is strong in archives, colleges, and city-governance traditions built atop OCE bureaucratic frameworks. Tessimir’s merchant clans dominate long-distance trade via river networks, while Umbrayel’s lantern-order provides stability through dream-guidance and memory rites.

Though prosperous, the Lakelands sit over several **fractured leyline junctions**, creating sporadic dream-echoes and zones of unpredictable magical amplification.
