A rust-gold plateau of broken mesas, desert canyons, and vast escarpments catching the fiercest winds from the mountains. Arid but rich in minerals, the Dawnwall maintains long traditions of ritual guardianship and ancestral devotion. Many clans trace their bloodlines to ancient peoples attuned to elemental nodes that once formed the backbone of arcane travel before the Shattering.

Thalvyr and Mirethiel share influence here—storms carve canyons, and seasonal flash floods define migration and settlement. Hermit-orders of Omyr’s truth-seekers wander the high mesas, believing the region’s thin veil offers sharper revelation. Numerous sacred sites predate human arrival and remain aligned to Aerathwyn’s and Vharûn’s primal symbology, though many were destabilized by Shattering shockwaves.

Residual leyline ruptures periodically trigger **skyfire storms**, anomalous bursts of lightning that manifest without clouds.
