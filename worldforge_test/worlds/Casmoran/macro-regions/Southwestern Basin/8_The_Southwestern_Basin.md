A warm region of golden hills, dry forests, wide shallow rivers, and sun-baked valley floors. Once a major agricultural and mercantile center of the OCE, the Basin still houses ancient aqueducts, terraced farms, caravan roads, and toppled administration towers reclaimed by local engineers and artificers.

Arturion’s influence runs deep: reconstruction guilds, waymaker temples, and technomantic workshops proliferate. Tessimir’s merchant families manage trade routes that connect almost every southern region. Isolated pockets of dead-magic from the Shattering remain hazardous and unpredictable, occasionally spawning Yhesseth’s entropy-creatures that crumble to dust when defeated.

Thanks to fertile oases and irrigation restoration projects, the Basin has become an innovation hub—part agricultural powerhouse, part experimental technomancer frontier.
